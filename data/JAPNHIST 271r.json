Class is laid-back and entertaining, and the material grows on you. The first few weeks are terrifying, but it gets a lot easier, and the final paper turns out to be a lot of fun once you realize you have access to a whole new world of source material."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["If you want to learn how to read early modern Japanese texts, this class is an absolute must. Try to familiarize yourself with the basics of kuzushiji reading and hentaigana. It can be intimidating at first, but things will slowly come together. Professor Howell is one of the few people in the United States who can really read hand-written early modern sources in Japanese history.","This is a great class. Prof. Howell brings a ton of expertise and know-how to the table and the class atmosphere was always laid-back and conducive to grappling with these texts without feeling inferior.","This course is fun and helpful, provided one really wants to read these texts.","This course requires a great deal of work and is not easy, but it is also extremely rewarding and fun."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["If you're taking Squiggles, you're already planning to do research in Japanese history--you don't really have a choice. The class is chill and laid-back, making for a relatively gentle way to get into squiggles, and will allow you to go to Japan and not be totally lost in the komonjo seminar you take at your university there. Squiggles are totally incomprehensible at first, and remain so for a while, but eventually it will get easier. Keep at it.","This class prepares you to work with early modern Japanese historic original sources."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"JAPNHIST 271R","course_id":"866","cat_num":"126630","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"JAPNHIST 271r","course_id":"866","cat_num":"49178","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"JAPNHIST 271R","course_id":"866","cat_num":"126630","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
