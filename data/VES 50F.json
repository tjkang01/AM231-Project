The process encourages such discipline and yields such beautiful images that the entire semester is very exciting (if a bit nerve-wracking). Furthermore, Robb is a very thoughtful person that always gives very useful feedback. I would warn that this course was a bit unreasonable in its expectations as far as how much work could be done in a short amount of time. Hopefully, the kinks will be ironed out in the future, but be prepared to work hard and probably come short of what you initially imagined for your projects.","Robb is fantastic, of course. Working in film, though, can be incredibly frustrated. Not for the heart.","Take it!!! You won't regret it. The best course I have taken, and probably ever will take, at Harvard. Never again will you get the chance to work with a machine as beautiful at the Bolex in this way.","- Incredible class. Robb and Luis are excellent instructors\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u201cthoughtful, detailed, empathetic. You will grow as an artist working in a medium with this many constraints. \r\n- Put some thought into a potential independent project topic (or at least an idea of where you might want to film) prior to the interview.","This is your chance to work in 16mm. This is your chance to work with Robb Moss. Come with an open mind, leave with an entirely new way of looking at film. P.S. digital filmmaking will never feel the same again...","You can enter this course with no prior knowledge of film at all and exit feeling like an actual filmmaker. This course provided every student with a sense of community and equality. We commented on each other's work with respect and with a desire for the other students to succeed. I loved this course and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.","If you are interested in film definitely take this course! Working in film is so much different than working with digital cameras, it really makes you appreciate every second of the roll."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"7.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"10","response rate":"90.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
