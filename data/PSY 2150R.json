I loved being able to be a part of studies being run in the lab, and being able to contribute to novel research being explored. It's a great environment; as you get to know everyone in the lab really well, and Felix is also wonderful, funny, personable, and super helpful to help you craft your own research ideas. Could not recommend this enough."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["This class takes up a lot of time but I found it to be a very valuable experience and a lot of fun. It's a great place to start working in a lab and I felt very involved, but working here did not feel overly intense.","Professor Warneken and everyone in his lab are really smart and engaged and friendly."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"2.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 2150R","course_id":"4308","cat_num":"125976","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 2150R","course_id":"4308","cat_num":"125976","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
