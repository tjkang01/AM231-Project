The professor prepared a wonderful curriculum, and discussions. I really hope that they will keep the class in future years, as I think this is a topic that is worth discussing especially at an environment like Harvard. I thoroughly enjoyed how introspective the class was, and I only have the best words for it.","This class has pros and cons, it is relatively easy with a very minimal workload. There is a lot of discussion about personal stories instead of the readings and I felt like the class generally could have a more academic focus.","Always remember to come into the class with an open mind and remember that people at this school have had vastly different experiences, although we have all earned our place here. Try to share your own experience and connect.","This class provided a strong psychological perspective on issues surrounding social class. Taking this class made me further understand why people of lower or higher social class behave the way they do, and this understanding provides a different perspective that I think is often ignored in discussions of class.","I did not learn much from this course. If you're looking for something rewarding, this is not it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"3.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"17","response rate":"82.35","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 1560","course_id":"12875","cat_num":"156928","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 1560","course_id":"12875","cat_num":"156928","1s":"0","2s":"9","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
