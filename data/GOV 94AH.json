You need to have a basic understanding of the Government concentration, and the expectations professors will have of you in terms of writing. You need to be well prepared to do independent reading (lots of it) and research, as well as to know how to write a political science paper. Going into this course unprepared is a bad, bad idea.","This class is great! You have a lot of freedom to learn about your particular interests, while learning a lot from other people's interests and a broad set of readings as well.","This course is good for someone who has an idea about what they might write their final paper on, because it provides a lot of great new ideas and Prof. Sa'adah gives invaluable feedback. However it should perhaps not be taken as a survey course of democratic theory."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"5.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 94AH","course_id":"13941","cat_num":"161203","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 94AH","course_id":"13941","cat_num":"161203","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
