I walked in never having read a Thomas Hardy novel, and I walked away feeling (and still feel) that I want to pursue Thomas Hardy studies as part of my graduate work.  I also walked away with a new favorite author.","If you enjoy reading novels and are ready to read a long one almost every week, this is the course for you. The theoretical material is challenging, but extremely well-balanced, and the coursepacks are tailored to the requirements of the course, so I, at least, never felt bogged down by vast amounts of reading. Writing and discussing short papers is one of the most enjoyable and rewarding aspects of the course, so do take them seriously!","Anyone interested in Hardy, the novel, the ways in which literature, science, and philosophy can illuminate one another, or simply in becoming a better and more sensitive reader, should sign up for this course at their earliest opportunity.","Take this course and prepare yourself for an awesome experience if you take an interest in Hardy. If you intensely don't like reading Hardy, then reconsider. This is definitely a Hardy-centric course (the philosophy is definitely secondary to the literature)."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"3.60","difficulty":"3.40","recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"13","response rate":"69.23","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 264x","course_id":"10779","cat_num":"2714","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 264x","course_id":"10779","cat_num":"2714","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 264x","course_id":"10779","cat_num":"2714","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"3","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
