I would recommend it with enthusiasm.","work hard!","Under new management, this course is excellent field preparation and deals with some of the most inherently fascinating (and conceptually challenging) developments of the early modern period.","This class will make you a better historian, a faster reader, and a sharper thinker. You should absolutely take a course with Katy Park because not only is she the top in her field, but she also wants to make your work the best it can be. Her class is a must-take.","This is a great course for people who are interested in the time period. Katy is involved and enthusiastic, and knows how to lead a discussion.","This is a very enjoyable class, the subject matter is lively, and the books are all worth reading.","Take any course with Prof. Kark esp. if you're interested in medieval and Renaissance healing and medical practices, the body and gender issues. Prof. Park has an incredible breadth of knowledge and synthetic approach that provides you with the necessary background whether you're an aspiring medievalist or just intrigued by the period."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.40","difficulty":"3.40","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"14","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HISTSCI 212","course_id":"2680","cat_num":"0500","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HISTSCI 212","course_id":"2680","cat_num":"0500","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"5","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HISTSCI 212","course_id":"2680","cat_num":"0500","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"3","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
