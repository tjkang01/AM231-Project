It's the only way that you will, after a space of time that short, be able to actually use Japanese academic work in your own research. It will not improve your speaking ability, but your reading ability will go up tremendously. Also, if you have been frustrated with the poor quality of Japanese instruction at Harvard prior to this point - particularly the horror that is Japanese 120, rest assured that this class is entirely different. Professor Jacobsen will explain Japanese grammar in a way that actually makes sense, and the daily grind will not overwhelm you (though 8:30 am class three days a week is a bit of a pain)","This class will teach you how to read Japanese language scholarship that is still necessary for research in China-related fields."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["The course offers a four-week unit of directed study at the end of the term which is very useful since students are asked to translate a scholarly work related to their own research.","If you are thinking about it, take this course. You will learn a lot from Professor Jacobsen. Also, it is useful to learn classical Japanese--even if you are interested in the modern period, it does not hurt."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["If you have found your experience taking Japanese at Harvard frustrating, you will likely also find this class frustrating.
