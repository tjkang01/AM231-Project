This course can be especially challenging (but is still very rewarding) for students coming from departments outside of MCB.","This course is a lot of work and spans a large variety of subjects. If you put in the work, it will be satisfying.","I'm not sure I'd take this as an elective but it was not painful for being a required course in an area I'm not planning on focusing on research-wise but which I felt I should still definitely learn more about.","Whether you want to brush up concepts you learned years ago or learn them from scratch, this course will be beneficial.","The main reason to take this course is the professors - they are simply amazing. The mechanics of how discussion, problem sets etc. work could be better, but if you want a great overview of genetics and evolution from 2 people who really know what they are talking about and are interested in making you understand it, take this class.","I think your appreciation of the course is heavily dependent on your interests. There are some very specific topics that may not seem immediately relevant to everyone.","Problem sets require a lot of time to complete and you will most likely need to go to office hours. There is a lot of reading to do for discussion.","This course offers a survey of fields at the intersection of genetics, molecular biology, and evolution. No topic receives an in-depth treatment, but you will leave the course better equipped to discuss research with many people outside of your narrow area of expertise. The lectures are the best part of the course, although the weekly paper discussion sections may also prove useful if you are willing to put in the time to read the papers carefully. It will be possible to coast through the course with a passing grade, absorbing bits of information here and there. If you invest the time to do the readings and problem sets with care, you will learn an awful lot.","this is a very useful and interesting course which can help you own clear understanding about evolution and genetics and provide a chance to know many terrific studies as well.","Overall, this course provided an excellent researcher's perspective on questions and approaches in evolutionary biology. It combines the breadth of a survey course with the specific details of an advanced course.","Work hard and often","Focusing on the general concepts\/big picture is, I think, more important than becoming frustrated by the details of how genetics works in specific organisms or the math\/programming.","This is a difficult course, but you can learn a lot from it if you have the background to keep up and understand the topics discussed.","Worth knowing the principles they teach you, not worth knowing the complicated examples they use to teach them.","The class was most useful concerning experimental design i.e. identify the problem and decide how to approach it. If you don't know anything about phylogeny and evolution, it's good idea to have an understanding of these relationships and you can get a baseline from this course.

Learning from students who had previous experience with genetics, evolution, or genomics helps to fill in the gaps from lectures.","Though it was difficult, I learned a lot about the fields of genetics and evolution.","Very little information from this class after the halfway mark of the semester will be useful or applicable to your studies.","You will learn a lot from the course and the instructors are great!","The class is very challenging and a lot of material is covered in a very short period of time. More often than not, lecture serves as a way of pointing out to you what things you will need to teach yourself outside of class. This class requires a lot of independent learning.","Pay attention in class; the lectures are actually great as a stand-alone survey of genetics, genomics and the state of the field.

I got a solid foundation for experimental design and clear utility of modern techniques as applied to answering fundamental questions.

Problem sets always involve quantitative approach to genetics, encouraging a strong fundamental understanding.","If you do not have a good genetics background, you may be exposed to a lot of material in this course, but mastery in any parts of the course is unlikely to happen due to the pace and depth of teaching","It's more like a survey of everything mildly related to genetics\/evolution, including history of the field so if you want to learn very in depth things about modern genetics take a different upper level course","This is a good course, but it will be confusing, and one should go in with some knowledge of genetics, and expect to have to use outside resources\/meet with the professors to understand the lecture material."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["If you want an introduction to a broad range of topics in biology that is fun, yet challenging, this is a good class to take.
