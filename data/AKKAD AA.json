I would not recommend it, however, to someone who simply needs to fulfill a language requirement. It is a fascinating language, but it can be difficult for speakers of Indo-European languages (especially ones like English, that do not have a robust case system and lots of verbal inflection) to learn a Semitic language for the first time and to start learning how to read cuneiform script too.","If you are not a highly skilled language learner, I encourage you to take this course in a semester when it can be your primary focus."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["This is an excellent class -- Gojko is an absolute beast in his subject and he's a pleasure to be in class with. By the end of the semester, you'll be shocked by how much progress you've made -- in just three months, you go from absolute zero to reading real tablets from Ancient Babylon and Assyria. Obviously, this is a very specialized course, so don't take it if you aren't interested in languages\/linguistics\/history\/the Middle East, etc., but overall it's been one of the best and surprisingly least-stressful classes I've yet taken at Harvard"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"7.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"2.50","enrollment":"3","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AKKAD AA","course_id":"3706","cat_num":"114320","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AKKAD A","course_id":"3706","cat_num":"4891","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AKKAD AA","course_id":"3706","cat_num":"114320","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
