I can honestly say that of all of my classes, I will remember the most from this course."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["It's a great exposure to developmental psychology research,but it is very cognitive and less emotional\/behavioral research, so know what you're getting into before you sign up. Also it ends up taking a lot of time, but the people in lab are really fun.","Working in a lab has been one of my most valuable academic experiences at Harvard.  It introduces you to real psychology research as well as technical skills that are useful in any field.  It is really amazing to work closely with some of the top professors in psychology."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["I didn't recommend with enthusiasm just because I think this course will be only suitable for those who have a passion for experiment design and research","Basically, in this course, you will schedule subjects, help run an experiment with your mentor, and learn quite a bit about your research field through reading papers, giving a presentation at lab meeting, and writing a final paper. It's a lot of fun -- the lab manager is wonderful and all the research assistants and researchers are very friendly. And of course, the children are adorable!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.33","difficulty":"2.67","recommendation":"4.67","enrollment":"6","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 1655r","course_id":"4281","cat_num":"1865","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 1655r","course_id":"4281","cat_num":"1865","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 1655r","course_id":"4281","cat_num":"1865","1s":"2","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
