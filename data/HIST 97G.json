You will feel as if you wasted a semester. Legal history is not nearly as interesting as you might think. Material history, biography, and environmental history, on the other hand, are more interesting than you might think.","If you are interested in pre-1700s European legal history or archival work, you will find the readings for this class fascinating. This is not an area of interest for me, so I really had to drag myself through the readings for each week. In addition, I found class discussion to be a bit stilted and the two hours always seemed to pass slowly. I would not recommend this class unless you are especially interested in premodern Europe.","I did not feel much support in this class. I learned more about writing from Expos. I would suggest finding another tutorial subject, as there is very little guidance given. I felt that the discussions in the two-hour classes kind of dragged on, and I never felt engaged in the subject matter. There are better tutorials to take.","Legal History will provide you with a very unique and strong approach to understanding historical events. This class will give you a very slight introduction into the level of argument required in law, which will greatly improve your researching ability as well as your writing. You will understand how deep you have to pry into any event to get out a true argument, and you will understand how clearly you must present that argument if you wish your story to be received well.","The sophomore history tutorial is a difficult class, but I thoroughly enjoyed this tutorial and got a lot from it. Professor Herzog and Louis are fantastic teachers who put a lot of effort into giving you feedback on your essays and lead very engaging discussions about legal history. Choose your research paper topic wisely, really think through the feedback you get on your essays, and you'll enjoy this class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.40","workload":"6.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.10","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
