research with Professor Greene! He started a field, neurophilosophy, and is still conducting cutting edge research in it. If you have any interest in moral psychology, moral philosophy, or, especially, the intersection of the two, he's your guy. And in his lab course, he won't just throw some project at you that you're not interested in. He'll let you design your own, and as you do, guide you through it and take you seriously.

Professor Greene has been one of my favorite scientists for a long time, and I've thought about the philosophical implications of his work for a while. Being able to work with him was really cool for me. The best part of his lab course is getting treated like a contributor, and getting to be involved in every phase of project I worked on, from that project's design, to its execution, to its evaluation, to its reevaluation, to, hopefully, its write-up. It would be easy for Professor Greene et al to treat his RA's like coffee-getting, study-running peons--but they don't. They treat us like partnerns in psychology."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["if you're enthusiastic about working in a lab, and you're interested in moral reasoning, I highly recommend joining this team of researchers!","Professor Joshua Greene and grad student Joe Paxton are both terrific teachers who do fascinating work and who are extremely generous with their time. They're both very nice, too. The highlight of the course for me was getting to work with them both, and getting to learn from them how to do psychology. Psy2554r is a tremendous opportunity to learn about both the discoveries and methodologies of moral psychology, and even conduct research in it oneself, with guidance of some of greatest and most influential moral psychologists working today--who happen also to be enthusiastic teachers and nice people."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["Very nice people, very nice lab, amazing researchers\r\nBe wary of spending a lot of time on one study.","Josh Greene and Joe Paxton are transplendant teachers.","The Moral Cognition Lab is great!

I really enjoyed working in the lab: all of the grad students are really cool, and Josh is great. It's an especially great thing to put on your study card nice because you're still doing work, but it's not the type of stressful academic work that goes home with you and gnaws at your soul during midterms."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["The Greene lab has probably the best lab atmosphere in the department. As soon as you start working in the lab, you feel like you're part of a team. Joshua Greene's brilliance only becomes apparent in small groups. You work on really fascinating research.
