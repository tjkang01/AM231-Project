If you do take this course, you will definitely learn a lot about Chinese history.","This is a challenging and rewarding course. Expectations are high, and classroom discussions are very stimulating. It's also a great cohort-building experience; I am pleased that I got to know some of my classmates quite well during the semester.","Definitely a must-take course for those who seriously want to go any further in the studies of Qing history.","Professors on the conservative side, but truly excellent!","Very difficult\/challenging class but you will be rewarded handsomely for the work. A must for Chinese historians","If you want to be a historian of late imperial China, there may well be no course in the entire country more valuable than Qing Docs at Harvard (though it has since been imitated at many other schools). The faculty are also committed to keeping the course up-to-date through both the use of the Qing Docs wiki and by adding new sources to those originally used by Kuhn. It is a tremendous amount of work; it will probably take over your life, but it is well worth it. Of course, if Szonyi or Elliott is your advisor and you are in the PhD program, you really don't have any choice other than to take it."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["What I have said to possible future students already is that they will enjoy it if they work hard."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"10.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHNSHIS 270A","course_id":"793","cat_num":"131334","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHNSHIS 270a","course_id":"793","cat_num":"1863","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"4"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHNSHIS 270A","course_id":"793","cat_num":"131334","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
