And that is a good thing. Professor Price is ideal in so many ways -- encyclopedic, charming, provocative, and more. The discussions in this seminar were the best out of any class I took this semester. Importantly, we talk just as frequently about the Victorian novel as we do about our profession, ways of reading, literary history, and where we fit in the grand scheme of things. The reading list is well chosen (and optimal for Generals coverage), the emphasis on Victorian and contemporary criticism engaging and challenging, the written assignments perfectly suited to professional development. A gem -- take it.","There is a lot of reading, so it helps if you have already read the primary texts. We tended to discuss the criticism more than the primary texts though.","This is a wonderful class!  Definitely worth taking, for anyone with even a remote interest in the Victorian novel.  Professor Price clearly loves her subject and loves teaching it to students; her enthusiasm makes the class really a joy to take.","This course consciously offers a comprehensive introduction to the Victorian novel and its development, as well as many of the reactions and theoretical debates which surround the literature.  It unconsciously models a teaching paradigm that combines deeply considered structure with adaptability.  Take this course and you will learn far more than you realize--which is saying something.","This is a fun and extremely enlightening survey of Victorian novels. As long as you haven't read everything on the syllabus already (and maybe even if you have) you should take this course.","This is one of the better classes I have ever taken."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"9.99","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"13","response rate":"61.54","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 256n","course_id":"11623","cat_num":"4996","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 256n","course_id":"11623","cat_num":"4996","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"3","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
