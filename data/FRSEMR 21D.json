There is probably more work in this course than in the average freshman seminar, but as long as you are interested in the topics covered, I would very much recommend it.","A great course for those who are interested in the subject matter.  The time commitment is perhaps a bit more extensive than would normally be expected from a seminar, but is definitely worth it.  The MATLAB and statistics skills learned in the class are very applicable to other contexts as well."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"8.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 21D","course_id":"13305","cat_num":"159728","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 21D","course_id":"13305","cat_num":"159728","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
