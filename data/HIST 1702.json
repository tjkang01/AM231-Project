Be prepared for a good deal of reading, but the professors are wonderful to work with and you'll learn a lot!  The course touches on cogent philosophical questions, if indirectly, and sparked inner debate about tough questions, such as the role of international intervention in any local situation, and whether a middle ground exists between universality and cultural relativism (as well as a questioning of what these terms really mean).","This course is fascinating. Both professors are incredibly accomplished and you will learn a lot. Definitely take this course if you have an interest in medical anthropology or African history.","This course is a great opportunity to learn about a very interesting field in a casual environment. It's also a great opportunity to discuss this topic with two prominent professors who are experts on the subject.","The course covers interesting subject matter, but it is unlikely to push you to think in new ways.","Take this course!!!","This is a very interesting class, full of great subject matter, and a wonderful combination between history and anthropology. Prof. Akyeampong and Kleinman work great together and are always encouraging. Make sure you keep up with readings so you are able to speak up in class.","This was a fascinating class. The reading is difficult to complete and class discussion is dominated by the professors, even when students are technically leading a class, but you will learn a lot being in the room and listening to those professors. Be prepared to structure the final paper by yourself with minimal feedback or support.","Just open your mind to learning new things.. don't plan on a lot of structure necessarily, it's more of a seminar-style class.","very reading intensive in first few weeks","It's a great course with a lot of reading, but the reading was thesis."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.88","workload":"2.18","difficulty":"2.82","recommendation":"4.29","enrollment":"19","response rate":"89.47","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1702","course_id":"2445","cat_num":"9704","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"10","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1702","course_id":"2445","cat_num":"9704","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"14","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1702","course_id":"2445","cat_num":"9704","1s":"1","2s":"12","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
