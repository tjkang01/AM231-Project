Super useful for people interested in computational genomics! Scott is super passionate about computational genomics and his enthusiasm is absolutely contagious. As an undergrad in the class, I really appreciated the combination of computation and basic science in the class. Scott really focuses on the importance of not only understanding the computational side but also the science that's required to generate your data in the first place. Definitely one of the best classes an undergrad can take in computational biology. Would very highly recommend!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.00","workload":"3.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.50","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
