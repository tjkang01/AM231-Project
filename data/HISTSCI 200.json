'07":{"comments":["Nice overview of the field and great lectures.

The attention to methodological strategies and wider applicability of the works were particularly valuable.","This course is a great way to cover some foundational themes in history of science. The undergraduate lectures are instructive pedagogically for someone who might one day teach this course, while the graduate section provides a great forum in which to become acquainted with key questions in the field. The reading list also contains newer texts so it allows one to read outside of what perhaps more standards lists might cover.","This is a fantastic introduction to and overview of the history of science. If you're a graduate student, you attend all the lectures and do the undergraduate reading, and then read roughly six extra articles per week for the graduate section, where you'll mostly discuss the historiography rather than the undergrad readings. Prof. Csiszar is a fantastic, enthusiastic, kind, accessible professor. Don't miss the chance to take a class with him."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["great course taught by great teacher","Graduate students will want to pay attention to the methods, themes, and craft of the writings we read beyond just the claims being made.
