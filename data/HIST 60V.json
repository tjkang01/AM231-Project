So sweet and friendly! The discussions were always very thoughtful and you get a lot out of the course! Very likely to recommend!","professor Warner is kind and caring and takes the time to work with each student individually. while her analysis is incisive and precise, she encourages students to think critically about scholarship in a great way (this was a big take away of the course for me). moreover, if you need to write a research paper or want to do so for the first time, do it with professor Warner--she walks you slowly through the steps and always makes herself available if you need help. the content is fascinating and Catherine has a good grasp on it. overall, she's an excellent teacher and does really exciting scholarship so there's nothing to lose ! sections were relaxed and casual but you still learned a ton!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"4.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 60V","course_id":"13953","cat_num":"161200","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 60V","course_id":"13953","cat_num":"161200","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
