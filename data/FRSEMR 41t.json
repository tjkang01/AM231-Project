It is a great introduction to that area. Also take it if you love literature. On a different note, it is also I great way to balance a pset or science-heavy schedule.","Considering there were only three students in my class including me, discussions were often extremely interesting and open, and controversial topics were embraced more than they could have been in a larger setting.","Great class for minimal workload and interesting discussion. There is a fair amount of reading, though you can get by having done hardly any of it because on the nature of discussion. What you get out of the class depends on your level of interest in the material (foundations of sociology)."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["A very involved, interesting, and enjoyable class. Every week, the seminar was something I could really look forward to going to.","This class is really interesting and challenges one to think in different ways about society and social constructs and constraints.  Prof. Malczewski is very open to discussing just about anything from the point of view which is developed throughout the course of the class.  Novels are read more for their value in understanding the society in which the characters live than for plot or character development, etc.","Eric makes it a priority to know everybody in the class and it shows in the quality of discussions. Just be aware that this is as much a sociology class as it is a literature class, as the novels are meant to be read as historical artifacts of their times. That said, you also get to tie the themes of the class back to your own life: the issues that nationalism raises for questions of identity and character are issues that every college student will have to grapple with. If you do the readings and participate in the discussions, you will come away with a better grasp on how to read novels and tie them back to your own understanding of the world."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 41t","course_id":"10839","cat_num":"77764","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 41t","course_id":"10839","cat_num":"77764","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 41t","course_id":"10839","cat_num":"77764","1s":"2","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
