The professor were great as was the TF.  The materials were excellent and the final project was very enjoyable.  I would like to recommend this course with enthusiasm to anyone who has any interest in the topic.  No knowledge of the Japanese language required (I was only of the 5-6 people who did not speak Japanese and got along just fine) nor requirements regarding past course work or summer experiences.  This was overall an amazing class!","It is a great course that will only get better as it is repeated.","This was a really interesting and inventive course that provided an introduction to digital scholarship and also allowed for the exploration of the tragic events surrounding Japan's disasters of March 2011.","Take it if you are at all interested in Japan, public policy, or emergency response in the aftermath of disasters.","Take this course if you are interested in a pursuing a rewarding experimental foray into digital scholarship. The content is also deeply engaging and meaningful, even if you don't have prior interest in\/knowledge of Japan and the 2011 disasters as the ensuing conversations apply to a broad range of topics across disciplines (media, politics, culture, aid, design...)"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"2.70","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 1923","course_id":"10658","cat_num":"34485","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 1923","course_id":"10658","cat_num":"34485","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 1923","course_id":"10658","cat_num":"34485","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
