'16":{"comments":["This is a great course that will teach you a lot about the molecular, cellular and developmental aspects of neuroscience. The seminar format in which this class is taught makes it easier to enjoy and learn the material. The weekly discussion sections are very helpful, but be sure to start reading the papers ahead of time as they are often challenging. Overall a really great course that I highly recommend!","You will get a lot out of this course, even if it is frustrating at times.","If you're an undergrad, don't take this. Take Cellular Basis of Neuronal Function or The Brain: Development, Plasticity, and Decline. If you're a PiN student, you'll take it because you have to. Grin and bear it.","This is a comprehensive course that covers important topics in development. Also, the methods talks are extremely useful for people interested in what techniques are available to cellular\/molecular neurobiologists."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["There is a big brother feel to the class, so try to keep a low profile. If you don't have a strong molecular\/developmental background, go talk to the TAs and Lisa, they seem very open to helping students.","This course will help you learn how to both write and read science, through lots of trial and error, and that experience is both extremely valuable and reasonably time-intensive. By the end, you'll have gotten experience reading, understanding, and critiquing papers, and following that up by proposing interesting future directions that have been opened up by the paper. Those skills are fundamental to have during graduate school and this course does a great job at helping you develop them.","difficult, but you do certainly grow as a grad student","This course can really make you prepared to become a scientist.","Read read read read"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.60","workload":"9.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.70","enrollment":"22","response rate":"86.36","QCourseOverall":{"number":"NEUROBIO 211","course_id":"12897","cat_num":"159930","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"7","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"NEUROBIO 211","course_id":"12897","cat_num":"159930","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
