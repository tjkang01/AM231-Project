The conversations can get annoying as students get into very erudite and theoretical interpretations of films.","Dennis is really wonderful and it is a privilege to have someone so currently active in the field teach a film course.","Don't miss a chance to watch and critique the latest and most groundbreaking nonfiction films from around the world - before they're available anywhere else.","Fantastic class that will challenge the way you think about documentary film.","Great exposure to documentary world","I learned more in this class than I have in any of the other 24 courses I've taken at Harvard.","I can't imagine the material appealing to anyone but perhaps a number of grad students.  Most people in the course were fed up with the material after the third film and from there on out the semester dragged on.  I'm saying this as a student who has largely enjoyed the vast majority of courses I have taken.  This one completely missed the mark."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"3.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"11","response rate":"81.82","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 178N","course_id":"12737","cat_num":"156511","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 178N","course_id":"12737","cat_num":"156511","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
