Tom's enthusiasm is unmatched and lectures are fascinating. Jungmin is also an incredible TF who goes above and beyond to help students explore whatever they might want to.","I loved the films and Tom's lectures are always the best, so what is there to doubt?","Let's be real--if you want to take a Tom Conley course, just go ahead and take it. It is fun, intimate class that allows you to delve into topics you probably would never do on your own.","This is a great class if you love film studies and Westerns. The theory, although sometimes complex, is really interesting in how it is applied, and is interwoven with great Western films and great readings of the films in class by Professor Conley.","Awesome class. Professor Conley is great!","Professor Conley is great but the class itself is not  as good","This course was pure fun. Great movies, great discussions, and fun discussions"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"1.60","difficulty":"2.50","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"22","response rate":"54.55","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 193","course_id":"11284","cat_num":"51896","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 193","course_id":"11284","cat_num":"51896","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 193","course_id":"11284","cat_num":"51896","1s":"6","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
