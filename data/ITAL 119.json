I found the films to be thought-provoking and the discussions engaging. Moreover, the workload is very manageable, as Adam emphasizes quality over quantity. Also, there is an opportunity for a creative project at the end of the course, which I really appreciated. Overall, the course spurred my creativity while strengthening my analytical skills.","Take this class. its a gem, and actually really interesting. It was well planned for a first time course and I can only see it improving.","One of the best courses I've taken at Harvard.","This is a great elective; totally manageable workload, really great movies, awesome teaching staff.  Definitely take it if you're looking for a chill class to compliment a tougher schedule (i.e. spring thesis season, etc...)"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"3.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"16","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ITAL 119","course_id":"13979","cat_num":"161242","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ITAL 119","course_id":"13979","cat_num":"161242","1s":"0","2s":"9","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
