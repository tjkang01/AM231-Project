Definitely interesting, but not my favorite. A lot of the research we read felt obvious or self-explanatory.","This course is a breeze, but at the same time you get to learn really cool concepts. Take the course if you are interested in bettering yourself or just need an easy class to get by on for the semester.","This class is so much fun and heavily based on discussion! I was always really excited to do the readings and discuss them in class. That being said, if you prefer taking a more passive role in class, it may not be the class for you, but I found a lot of the topics we discussed to be extremely relevant to my everyday life and overall found that this class allowed me to prioritize my well being throughout the semester.","Really interesting as a personal exploration.","This is a great class because you get to learn numerous ways of increasing your own well-being."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"3.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"16","response rate":"68.75","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 1001","course_id":"12786","cat_num":"156637","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 1001","course_id":"12786","cat_num":"156637","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
