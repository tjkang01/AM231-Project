Professor Blier actually teaches the material and engages with her students. Unlike many other professors, She doesn't just stand there and give llifeless lectures and except assignments. Instead, professor Blier wants to teach her students and wants them to learn the material. A wonderful semester.","Professor Blier was the highlight of the course. Regardless of whether or not the class ended up discussing the week's readings, her comments on a variety of issues and the wealth of her experience were incredibly valuable. She also provided solid feedback on weekly assignments as well as the final paper. The class seemed disjointed at times, but this often led to equally interesting discussions regarding topics that fell outside the syllabus."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"4.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"7","response rate":"57.14","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AFRAMER 188x","course_id":"12209","cat_num":"8120","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"AFRAMER 188x","course_id":"12209","cat_num":"8120","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
