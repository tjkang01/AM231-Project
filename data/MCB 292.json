deal of out of class reading if you haven't had a developemental biology course before.","Be prepared for a wide range of teaching styles.

The instructors picked papers directly related to their research area so although it was not very broad in areas covered, the lectures and discussions were interesting."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["If you know nothing about neurons, this course tells you why and what kind of questions in neural biology  remains unclear.","no one would take this class who wasn't an MCB G1","Read the papers for discussion and don't look like an asshole. Conversely, don't be an asshole to people during the discussions and it will be both fun and fulfilling.","Useful foundation in areas you may not have previously understood, but some of the topics go by way to fast to actually be useful.","Great lectures + Improving your writing skills + a chance to play with brains","I recommend this course because of the wide array of topics covered and the in depth paper discussions that we had."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["do not take this course if you want a basic\/general introduction to the topics. cell biology and neurobiology portions decent, with relevant background, but no developmental.","You learn the most from the discussion sections. Read the papers. They are very engaging.","This course gives you a good foundational understanding of many basic cell and neurobiological topics.","The course was unstructured (except for the neurobiology lectures).  The writing component does make the course worth taking.","Great class if you don't have a good background in cell biology and neuroscience.","Read the papers for discussion and participate in class!
