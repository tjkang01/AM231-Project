Professor Sarotte is very knowledgeable and the class provides an excellent  perspective on the Cold War and its legacy.","Unique class for government majors and a fascinating course for concentrators in other majors. Highly recommend!!!!","Great class. Interesting readings, great professor, and you have the opportunity for independent research which is essentially your term grade. Interesting class if you want to learn more about 20th century Europe."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This is a great class to take if you have an interest in learning about Europe in a small class and you get one on one time with an excellent professor.","Lots of reading! But if you put the time into it, you will really learn a lot. Keep in mind that even though this course is in the government department, you will be doing history-based analysis, which is very different from political science analysis. Make sure to learn the differences!","one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. Really teaches you how to write, think, discuss, analyze.","It's a great class - be prepared to read a lot, but its 100% worth it.","The course is heavy in reading and its focus is much more on history than on theory. Those hoping to learn about modern European international relations will be dismayed by the fact that more modern topics are only covered in the last couple of weeks. However, if you are interested in the last 100 years of European history, this course is probably the best one you could take."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"2.70","difficulty":"3.30","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 94ms","course_id":"5307","cat_num":"99751","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 94ms","course_id":"5307","cat_num":"99751","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 94ms","course_id":"5307","cat_num":"99751","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
