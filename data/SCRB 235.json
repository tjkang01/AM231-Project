However, from 7 sessions, there isn't much to learn, and there's no guidance or mentorship for the final project. In the end, I didn't get much out of this course that I couldn't have learned by just reading the 12 or so case studies in the syllabus.","Even though the lectures end half way into the semester, what you learn will be invaluable. You will learn many practical skills about creating a start up and how to make is successful. The professors are definitely at the forefront of the theory.","This course is the best course I've taken at Harvard, hands-down. It is actually practical, you will learn so much about startups, everything from financing to team to idea to go-to-market strategies-- so good and so rich. The professors are super cool, especially Prof. Sahlman (who even knows about Tinder!)"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.30","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"22","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SCRB 235","course_id":"11494","cat_num":"81913","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SCRB 235","course_id":"11494","cat_num":"81913","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SCRB 235","course_id":"11494","cat_num":"81913","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"4","4s":"2","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
