What are you going to do instead? Orgo? Seriously, that's pretty freaking lame.","This gives an overview of classical music to the present. It is not a monotonous history course, but we can really interact with the music by writing it and getting into the mechanisms behind it.","Professor Beaudoin is a ball of energy, and makes what could be dry information come alive.  His interest in the subject material is infectious.  His love for the music also makes him willing to extend his love to the students in the course.","That it is one of the few chances to explore the practices of late tonality (Debussy, Bartok et al.) within the department and is therefore something to be considered seriously."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["The course lacks some rigor, but is a good survey of Romantic period music theory (though not particularly of more contemporary music).","Take it!  It's fun.","Music 3 is a great continuation of Music 2, and the perfect way for non-music majors to supplement their music theory background.  The requirements are minimal but meaningful."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.22","workload":"1.44","difficulty":"1.89","recommendation":"4.44","enrollment":"10","response rate":"90.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MUSIC 3","course_id":"3614","cat_num":"5805","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MUSIC 3","course_id":"3614","cat_num":"5805","1s":"3","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MUSIC 3","course_id":"3614","cat_num":"5805","1s":"5","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
