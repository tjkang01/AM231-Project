What's fun about it is that you get to hear from and discuss with faculty who are personally working on these questions, and I think it is really thought provoking. It also strikes a good balance of science, psychology and philosophy, which I think is hard to do in a class. I would definitely recommend it!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"3","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MBB 980ir","course_id":"11035","cat_num":"21066","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MBB 980ir","course_id":"11035","cat_num":"21066","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MBB 980ir","course_id":"11035","cat_num":"21066","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
