We covered a ton of different cultures, and styles, and adopting my \"own\" art piece made the class even more exciting and involved.","A little disorganized, but you'll learn a lot about African art and culture. Blier is a flexible, open teacher and very knowledgeable about the subject matter. Don't be afraid to ask questions.","You need to be self-motivated to get anything out of this course.  The material is so interesting that, despite some issues with lecture and organization it was still very enjoyable.","The assignments are so fun! The professor has us all make a blog and post weekly thoughts about the African art object from the Peabody museum that she assigned to us. Professor Blier provides specific prompts for the posts that are incredibly helpful in directing students' research. The final paper uses these posts to build an argument. I loved the interactive nature of the course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.60","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 193g","course_id":"2590","cat_num":"58982","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 193g","course_id":"2590","cat_num":"58982","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 193g","course_id":"2590","cat_num":"58982","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
