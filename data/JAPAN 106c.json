Overall, the class is rewarding both for the skills in Classical Japanese that are developed, and also for the interesting discussions that come out of the readings -- on classical literature and culture, and etymology of the Japanese language.","Professor Cranston's classical Japanese courses are the best classes I've had at Harvard.","Ganbatte ne!  Enjoy, and make sure to keep up with the material and to analyze the grammar in every sentence, rather than settle on a translation only.  It will be helpful in preparing for the tests."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["If you want to sit down and read a masterpiece from a thousand years ago (Heian Japan) and try to catch the essence of each word of it, come to this class.","Professor Cranston throws you in the deep end, but you learn a LOT in the end.","Independent knowledge and willingness to work outside of class is necessary","Wonderful class. Speed of the class depends on the students (how many questions asked, how closely people want to examine the grammar). Sometimes difficult to know how much you need to prepare because you never know how many questions people will have that day."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["It's definitely a great course, we enjoyed the reading as much as the intelligent little talks from Professor Cranston.","The opportunity to work closely with such a knowledgeable professor in an intimate, relaxed setting is not to be missed. The course emphasizes close engagement with the texts and ensures deep familiarity with a wide range of post-Heian classical Japanese grammatical forms."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"JAPAN 106c","course_id":"845","cat_num":"7307","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"JAPAN 106c","course_id":"845","cat_num":"7307","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"JAPAN 106c","course_id":"845","cat_num":"7307","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
