This course is a fun yet comprehensive introduction to its history and the work of some of its greatest exponents.","If you like Urdu poetry you will enjoy this class.","Great emphasis on a specific poetry form. Perfect for those with an interest in the ghazal specifically!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["The class serves as a great introduction to some of the most famous Urdu poets and lines of poetry. It fosters a real sense of community and students are respected as scholars with something interesting to contribute. There are lots of different levels of Urdu fluency which can make it a bit tricky, but that's the case with most Hindi\/Urdu classes here.","I would highly recommend this class. You'll learn a lot about ghazals, especially in the classical period (i.e. Mir and Ghalib, Atish, Sauda). The Urdu is pretty manageable if you're willing to do a lot of dictionary searching.","You'll come away with some spiffy memorized shers of ghazals and a much broader understanding of the ghazal's context sociologically and historically. And Amy is a terrific professor."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"URD 104","course_id":"4815","cat_num":"0927","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"URD 104","course_id":"4815","cat_num":"0927","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"URD 104","course_id":"4815","cat_num":"0927","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
