Take this class if you are interested in learning about interiority in Vienna through scientific\/literary texts. There is very little art history involved, and I learned very little from the course.","I would tell them that Koerner is an excellent teacher and that the material is fascinating.","If Vienna was a \"dream city,\" Professor Koerner is its dream teacher.  He has a deep feel for the material (partly because of his personal history), he is an exceptional lecturer, and he leads pretty good discussions too (a weak point is that he spends a lot of time fishing for the answers he most wants to hear).","It's not that there is so much work but Koerner demands quality.","This class was very enjoyable, extremely well-taught, and introduced me to a lot of material I wouldn't have had exposure to in other classes. Overall, it presented more of a cultural history of fin-de-siecle than a pure art history, but created the perfect contextualization for a more in-depth study of the art of the time. The readings were an interesting mix of psychoanalytical works, architectural theory, fiction and poetry, and art history, and were very diverse, though I would have been interested in reading a bit more philosophy as well. Additionally, each session had a perfect balance of lecture, discussion of readings, and general discussion. Finally, Professor Koerner was very accommodating of everyone's diverse interests for the final papers, and was very available to discuss sources and ideas in office hours."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"17","response rate":"82.35","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 172x","course_id":"10980","cat_num":"89477","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"6","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 172x","course_id":"10980","cat_num":"89477","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"8","4s":"5","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 172x","course_id":"10980","cat_num":"89477","1s":"1","2s":"7","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
