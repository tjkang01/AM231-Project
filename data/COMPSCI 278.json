It's a small, seminar-style class that's conducive to individual discussion. If you're at all interested in this field, you will get addicted after taking this class.","Prof. Gortler generates enthusiasm for the subject. The papers are well selected and assignments are very interesting. I learned a lot about computer graphics from this course!","The seminar style is very appealing and interesting."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["It's pretty tough material but really interesting. Be prepared to chew through a lot of mathy papers.","This class starts off with an introduction to light transport and equilibria, then transitions to image processing and editing. So you'll learn a lot of the math & physics behind offline rendering (e.g. Pixar movies), and you'll also dive deep into the math behind image manipulation techniques found in programs like Photoshop.\r\n\r\nThis class assumes a decent command of linear algebra (it is a graphics course, after all). Although some background in optimization, harmonic analysis, algorithms, and other topics is helpful, the class is completely approachable with just the linear algebra.\r\n\r\nProf Gortler is an extremely knowledgeable instructor, and the small class size allows him to run the course as an interactive seminar (almost all whiteboarding instead of slides). The time commitment is manageable (read two papers a week + small monthly projects), but you'll almost definitely learn more in this class than more time-consuming pset classes.","Great course if you love image processing. Not very time consuming, enjoy!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"6.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"8","response rate":"62.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPSCI 278","course_id":"1276","cat_num":"116856","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPSCI 278","course_id":"1276","cat_num":"4883","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPSCI 278","course_id":"1276","cat_num":"116856","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
