I can't imagine not taking it.","Gives you great practice and guidance into writing and makes you feel more confident","Only take this class if you feel you REALLY need help writing, or struggle greatly with writing in English. I was placed into 20, but decided to take this class because I wanted to be a better writer (have never written papers longer than 2-3 pages, etc). I'm not sure if this class has met those expectations. I think that I learned to be a better writer, but it was basically the exact same thing that is done in expos 20, except much slower. The slow pace leads to boredom, and I regret that now I have to do the same thing all over again in 20. Also, in both expos 10 and 20 it is pretty hard to get a good grade, so that is another con. \nTLDR: I did learn quite a bit about how to analyze claims made by authors, and how to approach writing a lens\/case essay (the same kind given on the freshman writing test), but I do wish I had just taken 20 and been done with it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"6.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"10","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 10.007","course_id":"1586","cat_num":"86335","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 10.007","course_id":"1586","cat_num":"86335","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 10.007","course_id":"1586","cat_num":"86335","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
