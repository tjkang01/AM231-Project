Even if the material doesn't speak directly to a student's area of interest, this broad understanding of the field is valuable.","The subject as well as the subject matter is a fluid or can be interpreted in certain different ways--- is \"intellectual history\" a history of ideas or concepts? when ideas travel far and wide, do they still the same ideas or transform or metamorphose into another idea altogether? If you're interested in these questions, this is a great course to take.","If you are in a field outside of Europe or Asia then you will not get much from the readings without trying very hard to make them relevant. This is more a reflection of the existing scholarship and not the course, however."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"3.10","difficulty":"3.90","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 2300","course_id":"2478","cat_num":"7779","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 2300","course_id":"2478","cat_num":"7779","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 2300","course_id":"2478","cat_num":"7779","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
