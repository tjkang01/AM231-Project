He will talk you through what he expects and gives suggestions on how to improve. There is a lot of material and if you do not have the biology background studying for this class may be challenging at first.","You will learn a lot, probably more than you are expecting to. And it's fun.","This is a great course if the material falls within your area of interest. If not, the topics can seem overly specific and some of the material may be too advanced for someone without a decent biology background."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["The topic may seem narrow, but you'll be surprised how much there is to learn about this amazing biological system.","Great class that really explores the depths of the inner ear.
