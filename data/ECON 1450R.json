The professors are WONDERFUL people, the class is small so it feels very cozy, you'll be mind blown about all the theories out there on religion and economics - and no, religion isn't dying with modernization. If that's something that interests you \"why is that?\" then take this class.","Very interesting topics and the professors are amazing, the workload is a good balance, and you get out as much as you put in.","You'll learn a lot about religious economics but also the science of economics more generally. Do most of the readings and START YOUR PAPERS EARLY and you'll be just fine.","If the content interests you then you will really enjoy the course. Also, if you haven't had the unique opportunity of taking a course taught by two professors working closely together, then I suggest taking a look at this course.","I encountered lots of religion related words that I know little. The material is boring in terms of economic research.","The class was really disorganized, but if you do the readings, you'll be fine for the papers. Only take if you're really interested in the topic.","Fun class, great professors and interesting material"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.90","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"11","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 1450r","course_id":"987","cat_num":"43748","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 1450r","course_id":"987","cat_num":"43748","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 1450r","course_id":"987","cat_num":"43748","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
