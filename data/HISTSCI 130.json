Coming from a biology (HEB) background, it was so interesting and important to me to read the original texts that have created the foundation of Western thought about biology and reproduction in particular, and to see how ideas have been molded over time. Professor Richardson is wonderful and helps foster an environment for lively, thoughtful class discussions. Whether you are a History of Science concentrator or not, I highly recommend this course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"5.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"9","response rate":"55.56","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HISTSCI 130","course_id":"12475","cat_num":"17927","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HISTSCI 130","course_id":"12475","cat_num":"17927","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
