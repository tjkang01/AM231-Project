However, there's a lot of material and the expectations are high for understanding and applying the material.  Be prepared to work hard, but to enjoy the class as you learn","Ann is a great lecturer and the material is really cool. The problem sets aren't too bad at all so this is a pretty fair class as long as you have some background in the subject. Watch out for the final though!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Professor Pearson, although more intense than most of my other professors, will teach you biogeochemistry in depth. If you've taken 186 and enjoyed it, this class is for you. By the end of this class, you will be prepared to answer tough questions in the field, and I feel confident that this is one of the classes I learned the most in.","This is a great class, and if it is so small again, it's a really special opportunity to learn in an individualized setting. The material is difficult though, and requires real thinking in a scientific manner where many questions don't have an exact right answer."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.67","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"E-PSCI 187","course_id":"688","cat_num":"1923","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"E-PSCI 187","course_id":"688","cat_num":"1923","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"E-PSCI 187","course_id":"688","cat_num":"1923","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
