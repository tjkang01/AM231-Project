'09":{"comments":["Good course, covers a wide range of interesting topics.","This course is excellent when Professor Narayan is teaching it.  He is a superb lecturer (if slow at times) and he picks topics well.  The coverage is good for anyone remotely interested in the topic - I went from slightly interested in high-energy astrophysics to very interested because of this one course.  However, Professor Grindlay may be an excellent scientist, but his lectures and problem sets are really a waste of time.  This class was still a net positive experience, but only barely.  I'd say give it a try and see if Professor Grindlay has gotten any better... I got the sense he wasn't really trying very hard, and maybe if he did it would go better."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This class is a gem in the astrophysics department. I recommend that every astronomer take this class. Some of the analytic theory you learn is applicable to many areas of astrophysics.","It will take up a LOT of your time.","This class was an exceptional amount of work for a survey course. If you are planning on going into high energy astrophysics for your research, I would recommend this course. However, if you are simply looking for an interesting elective, I would recommend other courses.","Edo and Ramesh are great lecturers and much more coordinated than the average teaching team.  This course hits a lot of interesting topics, but doesn't go very deep because of time constraints.  Be warned, it is more work than the average astro grad course, but not unreasonable."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["The instructors in this class are like goldmines in relation to this subject.
