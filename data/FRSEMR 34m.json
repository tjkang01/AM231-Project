This class will teach you a lot about something you probably know little about - the life and work of a great American composer, conductor, and activist. By studying Bernstein, you will gain a greater understanding of his world (that of the twentieth century) and of the progression of music in the twentieth century. It's an extremely enjoyable and educational class. Professor Oja does a fantastic job teaching this course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"1.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"2","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 34m","course_id":"10811","cat_num":"0175","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 34m","course_id":"10811","cat_num":"0175","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 34m","course_id":"10811","cat_num":"0175","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
