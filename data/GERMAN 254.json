If you want to dig deep into some key texts that still today are talked about, this is your chance.","Discussions were incredibly thought-provoking and inspired ideas for future work. I am happy to have been able to participate in this seminar.","Rick makes even the cranky German Adorno come to life with his enthusiasm and expertise regarding the Frankfurt School.","Professor Rentschler is a very sharp thinker and critic. The selection of readings follows a clear agenda which is further developed during the discussion. The application of theory to film is enforced very successfully."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"9.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"9","response rate":"55.56","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
