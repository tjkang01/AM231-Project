The course is excellent!","The class is very interesting and touches on many cool puzzles in political economics."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Great professor and Great tf, just beware that the material is very dry and gets a little complicated.","Understanding the readings is a lot of work, but you will know a lot more about political economy by the end.","This course will give you a much better understanding of important points of country organization, welfare states, globalization, and a wide variety of topics that will help in other courses. Readings can be difficult but are definitely manageable and incredibly rewarding when they are understood.","The readings are great, as is Prof Iversen."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.58","workload":"2.42","difficulty":"3.08","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"14","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 1132","course_id":"2213","cat_num":"77322","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 1132","course_id":"2213","cat_num":"77322","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"9","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 1132","course_id":"2213","cat_num":"77322","1s":"0","2s":"9","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
