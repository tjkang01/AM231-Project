'09":{"comments":["This course is very hlepful for anyone who has some basic Polish language skills, and seeks to improve their listening and reading comprehension. The course offers a great opportunity to learn language through reading and discussion of various texts. Grammar and vocabulary are introduced\r\nthrough reading the texts, which is  a great way to learn."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["Overall, this course did what I wanted it to do: it improved my Polish speaking, reading, and writing. I felt more proficient in Polish at the end of the semester than I did at the beginning.","This is a fun class that will help you to hone and expand your skills in the Polish language."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This is a great class with a great professor. Pani Bara\u00c5\u201eczak is enthusiastic and is excellent in her craft of teaching. The course can be a bit frustrating at times if you're learning Polish with absolutely no prior knowledge (besides taking Slavic Da and Db), as those who have a previous familial background with the language come equipped with a much broader vocabulary than students who are coming in without prior speaking\/listening experience.","Be prepared to do a lot of studying\/learning on your own. This course is less guided than the two previous levels."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Take it! Polish is fun! You do lots of translation and reading, and it's all a very good selection."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["So much fun to be had. Take this class, Pani Baranczak is the best. The readings is this class were A+ because she was responsive to the interest of the student. She is willing to tailor the class to varying interests."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["The class is manageable, but the language is definitely difficult"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PLSH BA","course_id":"4530","cat_num":"124971","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PLSH B","course_id":"4530","cat_num":"41571","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PLSH BA","course_id":"4530","cat_num":"124971","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
