You'll benefit more from the discussions and you'll be able to see how the techniques presented in class are applied to actual data.","An interesting course with a novel teaching method that fosters interaction and a broad overview of all the topics involved. However, this comes at the cost of any physics rigor - i.e., a complete lack of from first principles derivations or microphysics.","Read Bruce Draine's textbook.","There's so much to the ISM, that this class can (and does) only really scratch the surface.  I came out of the class knowing a lot more names and terms of ISM things\/processes, but very little physical insight into how they work.","You can take a lot from this class if you read the journal articles, as well as doing some research on your own."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["We spent most of our time producing outreach materials (modules) instead of learning the science.
