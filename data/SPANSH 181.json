Although he is not the strongest lecturer \/ discussion leader (not by any means the weakest), Dr. Carcamo cultivated a strong sense of informality and community that made the class more fun.","This class is great!  Such great reading selections!  Professor Carcamo-Huechante is very dedicated to his work, as well as very flexible and understanding.  If you have a passion for Hispanic literature, you've come to the right classroom.","Professor Carcamo-Huechante made this class feel like a discussion among friends about some really great literature. There was no pressure at all and everybody really seemed to enjoy it."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This course goes highly recommended as it provides a case study in topics that touch salient and pertinent topics with regard to American influence abroad and sociopolitical responses thereof.","The readings are excellent and the instructor is extremely knowledgeable about it all: theory, literature and criticism. The reading load was sometimes a bit much and other weeks was more manageable. A bit less emphasis on the weekly responses would have made the workload more realistic some weeks. Overall though, a great and engaging course.","Some of the texts read in this class are great. Kahlil is a really nice professor, but if you are hoping for a class in which you can really discuss and think through texts together, this is not the class for you.","Take this class if you're interested in learning more about the ideas that influenced contemporary Puerto Rican and Cuban societies. The readings are enlightening and, with the right group of people, the class discussions can be very fruitful."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.25","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"57.14","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SPANSH 181","course_id":"4503","cat_num":"91471","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SPANSH 181","course_id":"4503","cat_num":"91471","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SPANSH 181","course_id":"4503","cat_num":"91471","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
