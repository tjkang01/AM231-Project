She is the rare Harvard professor who actually takes an interest in her students' intellectual development, and helps them grow beyond the requirements of the classroom. I feel very lucky to have studied with her.","This was a very engaging class with a very dedicated professor. I enjoyed all of the readings and the meaningful discussions that came out of the weekly seminars.","Speak","This course is definitely interesting and worth while. It has a manageable amount of work and is rarely stressful. Class time can be a little slow moving during the weeks with more dense reading material"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.71","difficulty":"3.14","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 90el","course_id":"1494","cat_num":"14149","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 90el","course_id":"1494","cat_num":"14149","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 90el","course_id":"1494","cat_num":"14149","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
