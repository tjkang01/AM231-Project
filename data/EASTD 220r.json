However, those people with limited experience may find amount of art historical knowledge one is expected to know a little overwhelming.","Fantastic if you have an interest in the material (illustrated narratives). Get to work with beautiful and fascinating works, but it is a difficult and demanding course. Trying to read the hentaigana during class without looking at your notes can be challenging\/scary.","It is difficult, and the material may initially seem overwhelming-- however, the exposure to resources and key pieces of Japanese art history are invaluable for any student with research interests in Japan.","Great course with a great professor.  Since it is one of the few Japanese art history focused courses, I would highly recommend taking it if interested in Japanese art history.","It's a tough class but the material is amazingly interesting--you really feel like you've gone through a journey by the end of it all, with a genuine feeling of confidence that emaki are now something you can use in future research. What seems at first an extremely specialized topic reveals itself in the hands of Professor McCormick to be impossibly rich with connections to countless aspects of Japanese studies."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.43","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.43","recommendation":"4.14","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EASTD 220r","course_id":"840","cat_num":"1685","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EASTD 220r","course_id":"840","cat_num":"1685","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EASTD 220r","course_id":"840","cat_num":"1685","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
