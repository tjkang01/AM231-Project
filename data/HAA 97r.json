I would suggest that for tutorial you choose something that you know about and not necessarily something that looks interesting."]},"Spring '08":{"comments":["be prepared for a lot of theory and almost no art.","Megan is the reason this class was so awesome; not that you have a choice about whether to take it, and not that you'll get her as a leader, but my personal experience was great.","This course successfully integrates modern\/avant-garde art historical movements with the cultural and historical atmosphere of their time. You will also gain familiarity with texts (i.e. Tafuri, Jakobsen, Adorno) important to many art history courses offered at Harvard. Megan also provides amazingly helpful feedback regarding your writing style and paper topic choices."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["Fab. professor, and the subject material definitely grows on you.","This course is a fantastic way to establish an in-depth basis of knowledge about modern architecture.
