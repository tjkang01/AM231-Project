Be prepared to discuss in class, as the discussions are valuable for everyone in the class. This was a great investigation of archaeology and art history as they pertain to Greek myths, and I highly recommend the course.","Prof. Staehli brings ancient art to life in a really inspiring way. He opens up so many questions about how to view and interpret ancient art objects. I strongly recommend this class for anyone with an interest in ancient greek art - or art in general! - as well as history, literature, archaeology.","This course allows for a lot of flexibility in terms of exploring what you're interested in. I would highly recommend a background in classical studies, especially Homeric epics, and being fluent in German helps too. Pretty low-stress course with just a presentation and final paper, and the readings throughout the course aren't too demanding. Prof. Staehli is fantastic and very knowledgeable--definitely utilize him as a resource!","This class is fun and interesting."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CLASARCH 149","course_id":"13300","cat_num":"160357","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"CLASARCH 149","course_id":"13300","cat_num":"160357","1s":"2","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
