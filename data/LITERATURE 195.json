In any case, great reading materials, great professor!","This course was both challenging and rewarding, and the section discussions were among the most enlightening I have participated in at Harvard. However, the readings quickly become cumbersome, and the way your grade is determined is\r\nperhaps unfairly skewed. However, the topics you are forced to grapple with are of a very high level, which may be intimidating to some, especially those without a\r\nstrong literary or philosophical background. Overall, it was a very interesting and unique course.","If you like modernist or contemporary lit, this is a great class!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"2.80","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"8","response rate":"62.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
