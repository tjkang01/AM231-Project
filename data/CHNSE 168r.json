This course, however, does require a ton of work - only take it if you are committed to really working on your Chinese!","For anyone serious about improving their level of Chinese, this course is a must-take. Not only will you be treated to engaging English-language discussions with Prof. Szonyi, but you will also be challenged to digest these materials in Chinese, whether in the form of weekly writing assignments or one-on-one sessions. Be prepared to spend a significant amount of time every week doing readings, memorizing for dictation (80 phrases a week), and completing writing assignments (800 characters per week). The course culminates in a video conference with university students in China, which is a great way to present your research in an academic setting. Prof. Liu and Sun Laoshi are incredibly supportive and accessible -- combined with the small class size, this course's intimate setting and challenging content make for a great experience.","This class is challenging, but very well-organized. The course staff were great at pushing us to improve our Chinese skills, but also being there to offer us lots of extra help and support. This class is a time commitment, but it is well, well worth it, especially the end of semester colloqium. If you are interested in history and have at least 3 years of Chinese, TAKE IT!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.40","difficulty":"3.80","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHNSE 168r","course_id":"777","cat_num":"59138","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHNSE 168r","course_id":"777","cat_num":"59138","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHNSE 168r","course_id":"777","cat_num":"59138","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
