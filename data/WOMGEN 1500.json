But other than that, Karen is great, along with the other possible preceptors if the committee decides to rotate.","Seeing as how the capstone is required, my comments here are less about recommending it than regarding its current form. Again, I think that the purpose of the course needs to be thought out and made clear to students and that this should inform the content of the course.","In theory, this is an incredible class. I'm so glad that it's an option in the concentration. There were a lot of things about it that were really fulfilling (not least the incredibly strong relationships I formed with everyone in the class), and it was in many ways a fitting end to my time in WGS. I have no doubt that future iterations of the course will accommodate its growing popularity in a way that allows each student to feel supported in completing their capstone project and less conflicted about how their project and the weekly coursework are supposed to coexist."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["I loved this class. The readings and materials were excellent, and it was the perfect way to do a research project without committing to a year-long thesis. The discussions were exciting, and I genuinely looked forward to this class every week. So glad I took it!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"4","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"WOMGEN 1500","course_id":"4936","cat_num":"72605","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"WOMGEN 1500","course_id":"4936","cat_num":"72605","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"WOMGEN 1500","course_id":"4936","cat_num":"72605","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
