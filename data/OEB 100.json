You learn a lot and really get to know the professor and TF's because of the small class size.","Demanding but rewarding to consistent self-organized effort.","This is the best way to get a sense of what it means to do Experimental Evolution."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["Be prepared for a ton of work.","This is a great opportunity to learn about microbial evolutionary research by doing it in a format very much like in \"real\" labs, with the added benefit of two extremely dedicated and committed mentors.  Invest some time and effort early in getting along with your lab partner(s) - this will make the rest of the semester much easier.  Also, make sure you are comfortable with the division of labor within your group; if not, speak up early.","It's an interesting OEB class."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["The course is very much what you choose to make of it.  You can learn a lot about designing and performing experiments, but it requires some discipline in terms of thinking ahead and planning your work, since the course is less structured than lab courses in other departments.  It's definitely a class that becomes more rewarding as you put more thought and effort into it.  The professor and TF are very helpful and accessible, and the course covers a neat topic, with experiments that can actually turn up some results in the span of a semester.","It's hard to pack research into a 12 week class, and the result is regularly changing assignments and extensive time in the lab with little to show for it. Prof is very engaging, but if you're taking this class, think seriously about why you aren't just doing research instead."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Instructors are awesome and will dedicate a ton of time to you having a great experience. This is a great, low stress way to spend some time doing experiment and\/or exploring experimental evolution, in a very quantitative way if you'd like. Expect to put in a lot of time, especially in the latter part of the semester as your project gets into full swing."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"5.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"1","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"OEB 100","course_id":"3936","cat_num":"9930","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"OEB 100","course_id":"3936","cat_num":"9930","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"OEB 100","course_id":"3936","cat_num":"9930","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
