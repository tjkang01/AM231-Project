Thus the course can be either highly rewarding or confused, depending on the participants, and I think the class would be most beneficial to advanced students with a pre-existing  and defined interest in the region.","This class is great for developing your project skills. I really enjoyed working on both the cultural sites project and my project proposal. By the end of the class, I was very passionate about both of my topics and wanted to keep working on them further! Another reason I took this class was to discuss Russian literature, and I was not disappointed in that regard. I felt I expanded my knowledge of Russian literature without things getting overly dry and theoretical for a non-specialist."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
