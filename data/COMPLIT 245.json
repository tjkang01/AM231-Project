The reading list is heterogeneous and of varying interest.","Studying intertextuality is a valuable way to study so many other aspects of literature: canon formation, post-structuralism, imitation, literature in the context of other arts.  This class provides a solid exploration of important literary theory in the context of both familiar and new literary examples, under the always thoughtful, innovative, pleasant, and engaging guidance of Dr. Ryan."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["Be ready to read a large amount of challenging theory texts. But the relevant literary works are fun, such as Milton's poems or Christa Wolf's Cassandra. This course provides a deep understanding of the leading poststructuralist theories as well.","An excellent course and interesting discussion, however the focus of the fictional\/poetic readings was not too wide-ranging.","The professor is brilliant, of course - but to me the most surprising thing was how willing she is to meet with you and work with you on whatever you needed individually.I took this course as an undergraduate majoring in physics, and I foresaw some difficulties because of a lack of experience writing seminar papers and doing the same readings that other members of the class were accustomed to, but the professor was incredibly kind and generous with her time and it was not a struggle at all to find necessary resources.","The class involves quite a lot of reading, both literary and critical texts. The literary texts involve show a strong bias towards the 19th and 20th century, English and German - if these aren't your areas of interests, they can quickly become tiring."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"6.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPLIT 245","course_id":"553","cat_num":"19804","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"6","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPLIT 245","course_id":"553","cat_num":"19804","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPLIT 245","course_id":"553","cat_num":"19804","1s":"2","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
