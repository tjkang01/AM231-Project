Love the teaching staff","The great thing about this class is how well everything fits together -- Evelyn's lectures timed perfectly with the labs, and Peter's pre-lab mini lectures giving additional insight.\r\n\r\nThe material builds on itself, which makes learning feel natural and fun. For example, we learn a process step in each lab: lithography (Lab 1), doping and metallization (Lab 2), lift-off (Lab 3), oxide formation (Lab 4), and so on. Each lab uses the process steps learned in previous labs, coupled with one or two new steps, to fabricate a cool device like a MOSFET transistor or a blue LED!"]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["This class is very useful if you want to go into fabrication and material science. It is also a useful class in general if you want to have a deeper understanding and appreciation for microelectronics and cleanroom tools.","The best thing about this class is how it builds up upon knowledge developed earlier in the semester. This gradual build-up is very satisfying and allows you to really understand the fabrication processes you're using.","Good course! Not difficult, but you can learn a lot."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"3.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"10","response rate":"70.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENG-SCI 277","course_id":"10587","cat_num":"109357","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENG-SCI 277","course_id":"10587","cat_num":"48852","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENG-SCI 277","course_id":"10587","cat_num":"109357","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
