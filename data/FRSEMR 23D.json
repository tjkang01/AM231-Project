He led the class discussion very well and supply necessary information. Robin is a very responsible and brilliant TF. We also had gourmet Chinese food every time before class started.","One of the best decisions in my freshman fall to sign up for this seminar. The weekly discussion helps quench your intellectual thirst.","This was an excellent class. The description is accurate, the professors are wonderful and accessible. They really cared about the class which made it an enjoyable experience. The discussions were thoughtful. Great way to learn statistical intuition.","I loved Big Data! Professor Meng leads really awesome discussions, and Robin is really great too! Having catered dinner each Monday and publishing an actual paper were awesome pluses, as well. I feel that I really got to connect with the other students in the seminar. It was a lot of fun and I learned a lot.","This class has practically no work. If you're looking for an easy class to complete your schedule, this is it. Work aside, this class was fun and enlightening\u00e2\u20ac\u201cit made me interested in statistics when I previously wasn't.","This class provides a very good learning opportunity for those who want to explore the realm of statistics. The seminar is very well structured. Each week, we read a chapter from Seven Pillars of Statistics (currently unpublished) by Professor Stephen Stigler. A group of three students is assigned to do a presentation of the reading, with discussion moderated by the professor. I got a lot of interesting ideas and acquired a deeper understanding of statistics from this course. By the way, we always have delicious dinner (usually Chinese food) together before class.","Best course ever. Barely any work. Robin and Xiao Li are the best. Definitely recommend!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"1.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 23D","course_id":"13290","cat_num":"160201","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 23D","course_id":"13290","cat_num":"160201","1s":"9","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
