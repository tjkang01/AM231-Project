The workload is very manageable, and Gui really takes the time to ensure that all of the students understand the material. He also facilitates discussions which end up being very interesting. We also got to listen to a lot of Brazilian music, which was extremely fun and interesting. I would definitely suggest taking this course!","Significan emphasis was placed on poetry and music. Students should be prepared and willing to ponder on philosophical questions, especially involving the utopia part of the course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"1.50","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"3.40","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PORTUG 162","course_id":"11117","cat_num":"35812","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PORTUG 162","course_id":"11117","cat_num":"35812","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PORTUG 162","course_id":"11117","cat_num":"35812","1s":"3","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
