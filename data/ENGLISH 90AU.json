The class was very interesting from a political perspective. Not an overwhelming amount of reading. Good discussions.","You're not going to have readings like this in any other English class, and it's a chance to learn about one of the most criminally underreported and underpublished societies on Earth.","This class was a wonderful way to encounter a very different type of \"literature,\" and it is definitely not your classic Harvard English course, which I appreciated. Philip is a great professor with an enthusiasm for the material and is very knowledgeable about aboriginal literature.","A great class if you are interested in indigenous studies and particularly Aboriginal issues in Australia."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"4.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 90AU","course_id":"13230","cat_num":"159615","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 90AU","course_id":"13230","cat_num":"159615","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
