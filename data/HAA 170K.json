This is beneficial for some of us who don't want the typical seminar class where the professor only facilitates. In this seminar, we had moments where students felt safe to \r\n argue with Ewa about the material, and I greatly appreciated the respect Ewa had for our opinions. The final assignment, an exhibition proposal for a fictional exhibition, allowed us to use our learning to think about what we can teach others, and incorporated a research aspect that, with support from Ewa, made us more confident about our chosen topics.","The class is an unusual and exciting way not only to explore the history of drawing, but also to gain some hands-on experience thinking about curating.","Good class that introduces many of the issues surrounding the practice of drawing. A privilege to directly interact with the works. Lajer-Burchart is a wonderful professor who really wants you to learn."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"5.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"10","response rate":"90.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
