It is a broad overview of major statistical inference topics with applications to biology: parameter estimation, model selection, information optimization, pattern recognition, hidden Markov models, non-parametric methods, and PCA. Lectures and sections are fairly relaxed, and the workload is very manageable. You can spend only a little time on this course and get out only a little, or a lot of time and get out a lot -- it's really up to you."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"6.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHYSICS 141A","course_id":"12581","cat_num":"156588","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"8","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHYSICS 141A","course_id":"12581","cat_num":"156588","1s":"5","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
