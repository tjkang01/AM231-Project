However, it's not as good if you are still figuring out your interests and want to really dig into the issues and theoretical underpinnings of crime and governance. You will definitely learn, but I don't think it's a course that will shift your consciousness and blow your mind. BUT! Ieva is absolutely wonderful and it's a solid class.","This is definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard! I didn't come into the class with much background on the material and I learned so much. Ieva is fantastic and goes a great job leading the seminar-there is a good balance between lecture and discussion and Ieva brings interesting material from current events in the region to discuss.","Take this tutorial! The subject material is fascinating, the assignments are reasonable, and Ieva is a great professor. You will not be disappointed!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"5.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
