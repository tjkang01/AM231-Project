If it's still going to have large chunks in the same style as Physics 251a and b, don't take it.","If you want to learn some practical quantum mechanics, take this course!","This class is good in the sense that it sometimes tries to put quantum mechanics into a chemistry context. When it focuses on math and physics, however, it is inferior to a quantum mechanics course taught in the physics department.","It is worth taking to see quantum mechanics beyond the theory, to experience modern applications of the non-relativistic theory which are crucial to condensed matter physics, chemistry, and quantum optics.  The caveat: students looking for advanced, new material may prefer to take more specialized and advanced courses.","I found the topics covered to be very relevant to contemporary research. If you are a graduate student in condensed matter, it's a nice course to take - especially in addition to 251b","The course is going to get better as it is going to get organized next semester."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.38","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.62","recommendation":"3.38","enrollment":"8","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHEM 243","course_id":"509","cat_num":"3622","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHEM 243","course_id":"509","cat_num":"3622","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHEM 243","course_id":"509","cat_num":"3622","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
