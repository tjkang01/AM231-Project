You will meet many great scientists in this class. Don't miss this opportunity."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["very interesting course material and interaction with speakers.","As long as YOU have a good attitude, you can learn a LOT from this class","This is a fairly laid-back class that brings in many leading researchers in parasitology. Each class consists of a discussion of these peoples' papers, hearing them talk about their research, and then hearing other students propose new experiments to try. The assignments are very focused on developing research plans\/experimental designs and are helpful exercises, but there is very minimal feedback, which can be frustrating. Get started on the final proposal sooner rather than later--it is a 10 page PQE-type paper and takes a lot of time to put together.","This class gives you an in depth look at many different types of parasites and their molecular biology, as well as genomics and bioinformatics. It gives you experience talking about a topic in which you are not well versed in front of the world's premiere expert. If you are interested in parasitology, it is one of the few electives exclusively on the topic."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"BPH 212","course_id":"294","cat_num":"0703","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"BPH 212","course_id":"294","cat_num":"0703","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"BPH 212","course_id":"294","cat_num":"0703","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
