Prof. Ziblatt is an expert in this field, and it shows. The readings are really well selected (worth the read, cover a lot of ground), the discussion are super interesting, and the assignments are generally rewarding. There is a definite emphasis on the course material as opposed to the final research paper, however, which can be a good or bad thing depending on what you're looking for. If you want to take a seminar that is about methods, this might not be so much for you. But if you want to really enjoy yourself from week to week and talk about some of the big questions of political history then this course is for you.","I enjoyed this class with Professor Daniel Ziblatt. Be prepared for a lot of reading and writing, but that's true for any seminar. If you're interested in fascism, and contemporary far right politics, there is no better class than this. There was a wide variety of readings, from novels to political science journal articles to history and more. I definitely recommend this course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"5.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
