I would recommend speaking to the instructors about the ways in which this course is being improved before taking it.","Great class if you are looking to see what problems are being solved in domains other than the most common internet\/finance domain problems.","To be forthcoming in issues with the course since it is new and focus more on picking up the important computing fundamentals."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"2.50","workload":"7.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"2.50","enrollment":"20","response rate":"65.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"APCOMP 290R","course_id":"13016","cat_num":"160444","1s":"3","2s":"3","3s":"4","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"APCOMP 290R","course_id":"13016","cat_num":"160444","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
