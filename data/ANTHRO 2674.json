Professor Ahmed is a wonderful professor, and it was a pleasure to be part of our this seminar. We were a small group with diverse backgrounds (anthropology, political theory, 'area studies', etc.) but I've had some of my best discussions during my time at Harvard. Whilst I am not an anthropologist, this seminar has taught me a lot and opened my eyes to many issues related to law, legalities, and modern governance. It should be interesting for a wide range of students. Definitely recommend!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"9.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"8","response rate":"62.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 2674","course_id":"216","cat_num":"127130","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 2674","course_id":"216","cat_num":"82966","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 2674","course_id":"216","cat_num":"127130","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
