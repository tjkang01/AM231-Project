He presents many great results in the theory of parameter spaces, deformation theory, and moduli in a down-to-earth, comprehensible way (by contrast, the literature is, to me at least, fairly impenetrable). There's an emphasis on intuition and examples, as opposed to rigor and foundational material. I found the homework quite difficult because the necessary tools often aren't introduced in class. This is an advanced course, and you're expected to have a lot of algebraic geometry knowledge at your fingertips: in particular, more than is covered in Hartshorne II and III.","A great course if you're interested in families of curves, or just want better geometric intuition."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.92","workload":"2.58","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.92","enrollment":"41","response rate":"29.27","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MATH 266y","course_id":"2899","cat_num":"98717","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"11"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MATH 266y","course_id":"2899","cat_num":"98717","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"7","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MATH 266y","course_id":"2899","cat_num":"98717","1s":"3","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
