The format, I thought, worked super well--and it definitely was the most attention my writing has gotten here, both on style\/formatting and content\/argument.\r\n\r\nProf. Mounk is really thoughtful and knowledgeable, and his input and guidance were really valuable. The other students also typically had good feedback to give, which was nice -- though that may vary from year to year.\r\n\r\nOne thing I would note is that you are expected to produce quite a lot: In addition to weekly response papers and letters to your classmates, you are expected to write 2 op-eds, a political speech and a policy paper or investigative piece -- and revisions for all four.","Yascha is the rare professor that is simultaneously brilliant and accessible -- I can't recommend his classes highly enough.","Yascha is an amazing lecturer and getting to engage with him is one of the highlights of the class.  Because it was the first year there were some organizational\/structural kinks to be worked out, but it is a laid back class that is great for those looking to develop their political writing.","This is a fun, low-stress (though not necessarily easy) course where you get to practice writing for wider audiences. Yascha is great, and really helps to make the course an enjoyable experience."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"4.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"12","response rate":"58.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
