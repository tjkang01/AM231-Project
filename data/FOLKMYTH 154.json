The readings are quite interesting! Some of the presentation assignments feel like busy work, although the final paper is open to whatever topic you choose, which is nice. I think in the future, Prof. Lowthorp will get the hang of leading and facilitating discussion a bit better and this will be a really good class!","I had no real idea about what folklore was before taking this course, and now I'm planning to be a folk and myth concentrator","This is a very intro gender studies class, which was extremely frustrating since I had already completed a lot of coursework in WGS. The intro to folklore was great, but I wish it could have been more and that the class was at a higher level so we could have had more in depth conversations.","This is a really great class to take if you want to learn more about folklore and about gender. Having had no prior WGS experience and coming from a conservative background, I feel like I learned a lot about gender as a social construction and questioned a lot of my prior assumptions about gender. Also, the class is generally very supportive, and your personal experiences are treated as very valid and very important to the class and the subject.","This class is amazing. It introduced me to the field of folklore, which I was totally ignorant of, and gave me a lot of new information about gender, which I'm minoring in. It was such a fun class full of really interesting people from various academic and personal backgrounds, giving the conversations a rich diversity. I had such a fun time doing readings and working on the assignments, and would recommend this class strongly to anyone even mildly interested in either the fields of folklore or gender."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"3.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"12","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
