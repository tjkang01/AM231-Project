The goals of the course are somewhat nebulous, readings are mostly relatively boring bibliographical essays, and the class often felt a bit directionless. That said, if you want to spend some time working on a Manchu related research topic, this class would be a good space to do so. It is also a chance to really start working with Manchu materials at Harvard, and so is worth doing on those grounds."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Fantastic course! you do not need advanced Manchu to take that class; you should take it if your are interested in knowing about what kind of Manchu sources are out there, and reflecting on how different material can be used for research."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":null,"difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
