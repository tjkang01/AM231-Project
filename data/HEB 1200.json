Professor Smith is great at breaking up the material to make it manageable for those who did not have a background in HEB. Overall, a great course to take without prior knowledge because the material is well taught. Assignments are never busy work and lab time is fun.","This class was probably my favorite course that I have ever taken at Harvard. I learned so much, but I also had a lot of fun.  Professor Smith provided us with some unbelievable opportunities to interact with members of the department and explore many different facets of HEB.  Although the course was challenging and required a lot of effort, it was absolutely worth it.  Even the assignments that seemed the most daunting allowed me to grow as both a student and as a person.  I really feel that I am much better for having taken this course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HEB 1200","course_id":"13271","cat_num":"160614","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HEB 1200","course_id":"13271","cat_num":"160614","1s":"2","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
