His enthusiasm and encouragement create a welcoming class environment.","It takes great discipline and focus, but ultimately, studying Sanskrit is very rewarding","Be prepared to get in over your head. Have multiple sources for looking up words, several different guides to grammar and syntax, as well as any secondary sources that can otherwise help you understand strange forms. Epic is especially tricky since its foundational while its grammar isn't set in stone.","1. Excellent practice with an epic -- hands-on!\r\n2.

Sanskrit is hard, but 102a really brings the language together. I enjoyed the course's intimate atmosphere and learned a lot.","If you can do Second year Sanskrit, go do it. But make sure you have a good grammar at hand when you go into this class.","The class is great. I couldn't believe how much we learned.

Tyler. Tyler is a rockstar and a saint, and you can count yourself SUPREMELY fortunate if you get to work with him. Never have I met an educator so genuinely concerned with the well being of his students, and who would work so hard to ensure that you have not only knowledge but a deep understanding of the material. He is fair and he is not out to get you. He just loves Sanskrit and wants you to too. He consistently went out of his way to provide amazing supplementary materials that make this difficult language so much more approachable.
