The problems are taken from graduate-level statistical physics textbooks and focused on spin physics and condensed matter physics. There were two types of problems: \"fill in the gaps\" of derivations we did in class with unnecessary, pointless detail, and \"derive more complicated equations\" than we did in class and that we've never seen before. By their very nature, these problems could not be answered from what we learned in lecture and required a significant amount of outside research.\r\n\r\nThere was no textbook. As a result, lectures were a desultory \"random walk\" through assorted topics in statistical physics that seemed to bear little relation to one another. If you didn't understand something in class, there was little hope of finding a better explanation in a textbook."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["The section\/TF is wonderful but the class lacked structure"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This course was the most challenging, yet most rewarding class I have ever taken--highly recommend to someone interested in statistical mechanics of chemical biology systems.","This class is a ton of fun, and the quality of teaching is quite high.
