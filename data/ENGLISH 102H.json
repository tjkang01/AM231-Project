It is first a language course and only then a literature course.","Take this class if taught by Joey McMullen, he is a saint and a great professor.","It is tough, yet interesting","A want to learn a dead language is needed in order to appreciate the language and how it is formed and developed over time. Also a want to know more about old english texts.","It satisfies requirements and can sometimes generate enthusiasm.","I only took this course because it fulfilled the Foreign Literature Requirement that the English and History & Literature Departments impose on their students, and I frankly dreaded taking it. I was very pleasantly surprised, however. The course is engaging and occasionally even fun, and the texts are terrific. It is not exceptionally difficult, but it is not a joke by any means, and the weekly workload (translations, studying for the frequent quizzes, etc.) is actually quite heavy."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.90","workload":"5.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"16","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 102H","course_id":"13007","cat_num":"156063","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"3","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 102H","course_id":"13007","cat_num":"156063","1s":"1","2s":"7","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
