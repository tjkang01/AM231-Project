It's an awesome way to get to sit down with the professor and to hear about his experiences with Tibet and his views on the culture and history.","Professor van der Kuijp had a lot to teach us on Tibetan Buddhism, and I found this course to be really interesting and thought-provoking.","If you are interested in Buddhism, India, Tibet, China, or just in taking an interesting cultural history course, this is a great course to take! The professor is incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and relaxed.  He really cares about your interests inside and outside of the classroom and always has exciting stories.  This course was the type of excellent, thought provoking, intimate experience that everyone says you will never find at a large university like Harvard."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Prof. van der Kuijp is just such a nice, kind, and warm man. You just have to sit back and listen to his wonderful stories about Tibet, India, China, Buddhism, Sanskrit, Hinduism, etc.","This class is a must take if you're interested in Buddhism or the political issues surrounding self determination and China. Be prepared for long, but interesting lectures and also feel comfortable asking if you can discuss certain topics as a class rather than just listen to lectures, Professor Van Der Kuijp is very understanding.","Sometimes the lectures get monotonous, but if you're really interested in Tibet than it's worth it.","This is a great Freshman seminar that really engages you and you truly learn a lot about Tibetan history and the current state of Tibet."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.43","workload":"1.29","difficulty":"1.29","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 32x","course_id":"1828","cat_num":"2937","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 32x","course_id":"1828","cat_num":"2937","1s":"5","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 32x","course_id":"1828","cat_num":"2937","1s":"5","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
