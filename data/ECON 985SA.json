This class provides very helpful support and guidance during the thesis process. My thesis seminar teacher has been more helpful than my thesis advisor. If you write an econ thesis and have schedule space, take it!","Jonas is a great instructor to have for Ec985!!","Be prepared to do a lot of work, more than you expect after coming into a Thesis Seminar after taking many writing courses where you have to do a final empirical research paper. Start as early as possible, but know that many things can and will go wrong, just don't get discouraged and know you can always drop as late as you need to.","This course made writing a thesis much less scary. However, writing a thesis is still a really big decision, so think a lot before making it.","Need to have good experience writing in econometrics."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"10.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"10","response rate":"70.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 985SA","course_id":"13132","cat_num":"160585","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 985SA","course_id":"13132","cat_num":"160585","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
