Highly recommend!","Senior history of science concentrators would get a lot out of this course, especially if they plan to apply to graduate school.  I highly recommend this class!","Sophia does a great job leading discussions, but she typically won't call on you so it is important to speak up if you want to contribute to the discussion. Be sure to meet with her outside of class both about the paper assignments and the presentation. She provides incredibly helpful feedback during office hours.","Prof. Roosth is brilliant, fantastic, and welcoming. This was her first time teaching the course, so the syllabus will change somewhat by the time she teaches it next, but I enjoyed most of the readings and the discussions. You have quite a bit of latitude in choosing a topic for the final research paper."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"9.99","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"11","response rate":"36.36","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HISTSCI 235","course_id":"12481","cat_num":"24576","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HISTSCI 235","course_id":"12481","cat_num":"24576","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
