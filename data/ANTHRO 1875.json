Be prepared to pick out the important parts of a mountain of readings.","This course is very theory-heavy. They're good theories to know about, but just make sure that's what you want. You do get to watch a bunch of random Youtube clips.","...","I don't think that the amount of theory read is for everyone.","This is a very interesting and relevant class, but there is a lot of reading.","Steedly's lectures don't really captivate me, especially when she goes on tangents. Interesting concepts and materials but can definitely be tied together better in the course.","The class is interesting and not too taxing. However, prior interest in media is definitely recommended. The readings can be a bit dry. However, the material is very relevant to daily life.","The material covered is very pertinent. Never before was I forced to address the fact that file systems reflect the post-modern need for hierarchical systems of knowledge. Plus, the art theory is fairly accessible, which is a major accomplishment."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Very interesting and relevant course material."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.75","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 1875","course_id":"176","cat_num":"46551","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 1875","course_id":"176","cat_num":"46551","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 1875","course_id":"176","cat_num":"46551","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
