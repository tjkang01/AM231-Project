Lectures cover general topics in chromatin biology, while the discussion sessions allows you to discuss, in a very personal way, seminal papers in the chromatin field with the senior author behind them. This is a luxury, seldomly encountered."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["Relatively low pressure environment and easy way to get a guided tour of the field of chromatin dynamics.","Great way to flash-meet with successful Harvard affiliated faculty members working in chromatin biology field. I would recommend for G1s to take it to hear their studies from first hand to decide on a potential rotation.","A rare introduction to epigenetics and chromatin dynamics. It is also a very flexible class, which made it possible to take this course on top of a very heavy workload and many experiments"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"3.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"25","response rate":"48.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CELLBIO 307QC","course_id":"3024","cat_num":"107455","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CELLBIO 307qc","course_id":"3024","cat_num":"91774","1s":"2","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CELLBIO 307QC","course_id":"3024","cat_num":"107455","1s":"4","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
