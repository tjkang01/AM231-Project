If you're not good at Greek, however, think about taking another class."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["This class is difficult, but worth it!","David Elmer is as good as it gets.  Rob Cioffi is a TF for the ages.","While the workload is pretty high (and in fact rather difficult at times), in the end you learn a great deal in the class, and your knowledge of Greek expands considerably. Though tough while you are taking the class, at the end you are happy that you did.","It will be mandatory soon, and even in the hypothetical situation in which people were still taking generals, it is absolutely necessary for generals prep.  I would absolutely NOT recommend it for non-Classics-concentrators.","Do not take this as your first 100-level Greek class. Do not take this as your second 100-level Greek class. Take this as your *last* 100-level Greek class.
