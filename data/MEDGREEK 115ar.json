change of pace, as it were, in their Greek experience, or for those at all interested in sampling what Byzantium has to offer. Certain of the writings will be more interesting and other less so, but there's something for everyone."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["I would tell future students to should make sure they have a strong grasp of Classical Greek grammar before considering this class. They may also benefit from having an introductory course in Modern Greek under their belts; often the vocabulary and syntax of vernacular Medieval Greek texts resemble their modern namesakes more than their ancient forerunners, and I frequently found myself wishing that I had a stronger grounding in Modern Greek. Moreover, I would advise future students to familiarize themselves with the myriad of various lexicons available (Trapp, Liddell and Scott, Lampe, E. A. Sophocles) needed to navigate the sometimes-challenging vocabulary of Byzantine texts. Such students may also benefit from a reading knowledge of German, as the principal Byzantine Greek lexicon (Trapp) and some of the most important secondary literature (Krumbacher, Beck, Hunger) are all in German."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["Don't be as concerned with your Greek level of ability upon entering the course because Fr Maximos and the peers will be considerate and helpful in assisting you along."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"4","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MEDGREEK 115","course_id":"5014","cat_num":"121896","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MEDGREEK 115ar","course_id":"5014","cat_num":"7682","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MEDGREEK 115","course_id":"5014","cat_num":"121896","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
