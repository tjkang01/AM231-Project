It does not provide them on a plate, however, and some serious wrangling with the readings and presentations is needed to get the most out of the class.  The workload is very light if you do no readings; quite heavy if you do them all.","The lecture format is dry, but the overall topic matter is fascinating. More group projects or papers might make the course more fulfilling.","Learn from the experts in the field","I think you can always learn new and interesting things from Prof Sen, and Prof Atkinson is a wealth of knowledge and fantastic person to boot. This was an enjoyable class that never fully came together.","Sen and Atkinson are incredible academics but neither is a very good lecturer and the course is not that interesting."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.90","workload":"1.85","difficulty":"3.10","recommendation":"3.85","enrollment":"22","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 2085","course_id":"1030","cat_num":"16767","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"8","4s":"6","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 2085","course_id":"1030","cat_num":"16767","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"15","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 2085","course_id":"1030","cat_num":"16767","1s":"6","2s":"11","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
