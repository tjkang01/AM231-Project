You'll watch a variety of movies and learn to watch more critically.","This is really a fantastic class. You get to watch some great films and learn to look at them with a critical eye.  Really the only assignments each week are watching the film, and that's really a pleasure.  Class discussions are great, and the class presentation format is really spectacular.","Lots of fun, Danny is great at encouraging discussion","A lot of fun and a great way to learn more about historical films instead of watching Mean Girls every time you want to watch a movie.","Fun section and you get a lot of exposure to cool movies you would likely not see otherwise, but be prepared for 3-5 hours of work outside of class per week.","Definitely a great freshman seminar to go for. You get to see a lot of great movies and learn a lot more about the historical context of them.","This movies of this course are really fun to watch and provide a really good break from the routine studying that most classes have."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"11","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
