I would not recommend taking this class if students are still in charge of presenting the papers. Many of the papers are not conducive to interesting discussion and the discussion was consistently focused on the negative.","Unless the class is substantially restructured to have more student feedback, better organization and contextualization of content, and presentations by faculty, I can't recommend taking this class, barring you already have a fairly good grasp on reading papers and connectomics, and are really interested by those questions.","Joint Harvard\/MIT world-class faculty and fellow students, frontier of neurobiology research, hands-on experience with real EM data, this is THE course to take whenever possible!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"2.12","difficulty":"2.88","recommendation":"3.12","enrollment":"10","response rate":"90.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MCB 206","course_id":"3568","cat_num":"2303","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MCB 206","course_id":"3568","cat_num":"2303","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MCB 206","course_id":"3568","cat_num":"2303","1s":"1","2s":"6","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
