The subject matter is fascinating and very applicable to today's world.","Really interesting and important material. Crucial to understanding the world today. Do the readings, they are worth it. And go to the film screenings","You will learn to think more clearly about really important issues for our day and age. Take this course - you will come out of it with a great knowledge of gender and Islam, and much more mature opinions.","The material is interesting and can facilitate good discussion in section. However, the lectures in class can devolve into tangents and can seem unstructured.","There's a TON of content, and if you can't keep yourself organized it's tough to keep up with all the reading and assignments.

Be prepared to do a lot of reading or split the reading with someone else. Lectures can sometimes be a bit dry, but section is pretty good.","While not as flexible as other courses, it definitely delves in depth into the information that it does cover.","If you want your stereotypical understandings of gender, Islam, and the Middle East to be challenged and changed for the better, then I recommend this course for you.","It's great!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.86","workload":"2.14","difficulty":"3.14","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CULTR&BLF 41","course_id":"1955","cat_num":"0352","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"6","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CULTR&BLF 41","course_id":"1955","cat_num":"0352","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CULTR&BLF 41","course_id":"1955","cat_num":"0352","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
