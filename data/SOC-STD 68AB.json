You not only learn about the history and theory behind organizing and leadership, you learn about yourself. Also, you make great friends and great memories with some of Harvard's most fearless leaders. And, you get to be in a small seminar with Marshall Ganz himself. Any Kennedy student would be jealous. These may sound like things you do not need to learn, but once you take it, you will see what a difference it makes. But don't expect it to be easy! And make sure to have a project in mind that you care about; you will be spending a lot of time on it!!","It will change your life.","This class will actually change your life, and getting to know Marshall Ganz will as well. You will not regret taking this class for one second.","This class was one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. Marshall is an incredible instructor and creates an environment that really allows every student to grow and reflect. Definitely take it if you are on the fence.","This course is challenging but absolutely worth all the hard work it requires. I don't think any background knowledge or prior experiences are required. It is necessary that you are willing to work hard on the reading, writing, and project components of the class. Seriously, don't take this class if you're not down to work, but if you're willing to work, this is the best course I've taken at Harvard."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"9.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOC-STD 68AB","course_id":"13322","cat_num":"159822","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOC-STD 68AB","course_id":"13322","cat_num":"159822","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
