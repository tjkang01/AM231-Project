'09":{"comments":["I usually tell other students that the African language program as a whole is great in its flexibility and great if you're looking to learn a little bit of an African language in a low-key, unstressful way.  It's not going to help you learn a language quickly and fluently, if that's what you're looking for."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["If you have reached an intermediate level in the language, translation is an excellent way to take your understanding of the language to the next level.  By pushing yourself to read at a more advanced level, you are exposed to new grammatical structures and vocabulary.

You also get to know some things about malawi if you take time to communicate with the teaching fellow"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This class was a great introduction to Chichewa! Chidzero was an awesome instructor and was very responsive to the needs of the students. It was a fairly small class, conducive to personalized learning. This will be very helpful if you plan on going to Malawi.","Take this comment with a grain of salt, as the instructor is moving to Texas, but I think it often applies to African language classes generally; This class may well be exactly what you make of it. The instructor is an excellent resource, but may have very low default expectations. If you are busy, you may get by just fine without any work; if you have time, push yourself and push the instructor and you will have a much more rewarding experience. I love the African Language Program, and I enjoyed this class, but keep this in mind.","This is a fun class if you want to learn a local language with personal instruction from the teaching staff"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"1","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AFRAMER 90R.D","course_id":"10","cat_num":"126303","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AFRAMER 90r.d","course_id":"10","cat_num":"22841","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AFRAMER 90R.D","course_id":"10","cat_num":"126303","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
