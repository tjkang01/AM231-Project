Assignments let you get  a closer look, but were never overwhelming. No busy work in this course, which is great. There was a wide range of activities, and I loved the museum visits. The course manages to be both a lot of fun, and very learning intensive. We had some really great in-class discussions! We even had a hands-on activity in recycling which was both engaging and thought-provoking. Anyone interested in the Germanic world NEEDS TO TAKE. Improve your German while learning material very important to German (and Germanic world) history and thought. It managed to be intensive, broad-ranging, probing, but never over-whelming, which is quite a feat for any course! Because the class is split up to two days a week, work should always be manageable. Class can even be taken concurrently with thesis writing without any major issue. Professor is very flexible and very responsive with feedback!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
