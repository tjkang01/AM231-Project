You'll be amazed where you end up by the end!","The course is whatever you make of it, so be self-motivated and work on things that really interest you. You can range far and wide in your readings, but take notes as you go- it will be very helpful later on.","Remember that you do not have to read EVERYTHING in your junior tutorial, only something. Similarly, you don't have to write your junior essay about everything, only something. The junior essay is blessedly due before reading period, ie before any of your other final papers - so take advantage of this and really spend time on it!","Enjoy your tutorial as much as possible! Take liberties to read what you want. Study some films. Begin your paper right after spring break and have fun with it.","Take full advantage of you tutorial!  It's an awesome opportunity.","The individualized tutorials are one of the highlights of the Literature department -- the opportunity to develop a close working relationship with your tutor and explore your research interests in a supportive, pressure-free space is truly unparalleled.","Second semester of junior tutorial is great fun and you will learn so much throughout the process of writing your junior paper."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"2.70","difficulty":"3.40","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"13","response rate":"76.92","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LITER 98b","course_id":"591","cat_num":"1528","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"11"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LITER 98b","course_id":"591","cat_num":"1528","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"5","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LITER 98b","course_id":"591","cat_num":"1528","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"2","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
