The course matter is pretty interesting, and because the topic is so new all the information can be accessed online which makes research and collection of information much easier than in other classes.","This is a great class if you care at all about these issues. Otherwise you might be bored.","A expos course that has a great teacher and interesting topic.","Dr. Sinnott is a truly invested preceptor. If you are interested in Surveillance, and have some willingness to improve your writing, then you'll get a good amount out of this course. Dr. Sinnott's feedback was very helpful, and she really goes out of her way to provide valuable insights, which is why putting effort into your draft is worth it. Overall, a very good course (as in compared to other \"normal\" courses, not only to other expos topics).","Great class if you are interested in the law and national security.","Much more relevant than you would think","Great professor, start the research paper early. Start the research paper EARLY. START THE RESEARCH PAPER EARLY.\r\n\r\nOther than that, a semi-painless (but still relatively painful) way to get your expos requirement out of the way. At least it's not the Rise of China","Readings are interesting, professor is very involved, and cares highly about students. Would recommend even if you're not interested in the topic.","It's definitely an interesting class and you learn a lot. However, you have to accept the fact that you have a lot of work to do.","I absolutely loved this class. The information is incredibly interesting and relevant, and I really liked the split of focus on law and ethics."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"6.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"15","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.284","course_id":"12751","cat_num":"156596","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.284","course_id":"12751","cat_num":"156596","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
