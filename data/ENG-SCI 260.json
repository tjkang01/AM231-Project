Come ready to think critically and get to the solutions.","This is an excellent class. A solid background in contemporary geopolitics and resource economics as well as knowledge about policy brief-style writing and thinking will make it easier for you to succeed in this class. Some engineering knowledge would be helpful, too. It's a challenging class, but the material is incredibly relevant and the class discussions were some of the best I've experienced at Harvard. Professor Briscoe is an incredible scholar and person who knows the world of water and development better than most people in the field. He is brilliant, helpful, and humble."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"33.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENG-SCI 260","course_id":"11469","cat_num":"96956","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENG-SCI 260","course_id":"11469","cat_num":"96956","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENG-SCI 260","course_id":"11469","cat_num":"96956","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
