We have precious few opportunities to do coursework in grad school, and I feel I squandered one such slot on this class.  Neither Theda or Mary put time or effort into teaching this semester.","I do not recommend this course at all. The course readings are very lengthy and require a substantial amount of work. The class is set up to be a seminar style, in which participation is required. However, the in-class experience is run much like a lecture, where one person dominates the class. \r\n\r\nWhile a part of your grade is based on participation, it is very difficult to participate because you are constantly interrupted and cut-off. If your are able to finish your comments--no matter how intelligent and relevant they are--you will be cut down immediately by one of the professors. This has very detrimental effects on in-class discussion and participation. \r\n\r\nThere is a clear line between constructive criticism and criticism. Again, the one dominating professor voices her opinion against almost anything that is said."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"2.88","workload":"2.75","difficulty":"3.25","recommendation":"2.75","enrollment":"10","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOCIOL 223","course_id":"4699","cat_num":"15067","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOCIOL 223","course_id":"4699","cat_num":"15067","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOCIOL 223","course_id":"4699","cat_num":"15067","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
