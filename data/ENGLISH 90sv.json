You will come away with a better understanding of the reading material and Victorian life, along with the valuable skills of how to read, dissect, and connect such works with one another. The class is quite difficult however, so be prepared. I felt overwhelmed at times but I had never taken an English class before and so I think it was in large part due to that.","This course was a great pleasure- tearing through some of the best books in the English cannon and then following them up with fist-pounding discussion.","Be prepared for a lot of reading, but very interesting reading. Prof. Price leads very interesting classes every week!","If you are interested in gender issues, love Victorian literature, or want a good English 90 level seminar to fulfill your requirements, I would highly recommend this class.","Take the course if you are really invested in the subject matter, otherwise, there are other english electives to take that you may want to take.","Professor Price is amazing - take advantage of the opportunity to learn from her in such a small seminar setting."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.45","workload":"2.80","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.45","enrollment":"15","response rate":"73.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 90sv","course_id":"1513","cat_num":"99381","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 90sv","course_id":"1513","cat_num":"99381","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 90sv","course_id":"1513","cat_num":"99381","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"4","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
