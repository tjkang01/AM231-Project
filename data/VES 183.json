Great lectures and films. Not to be missed.","Dr. Conley is an awesome, passionate teacher.  His enthusiasm implicitly encourages the class to dive headfirst into the material.","Professor Tom Conley's lectures are always miraculously inspiring. His digressions will provide you with two new eyes to watch cinema.","Amazing class. Section was also wonderful. I learned a great deal about film and how to analyze a body of work. I came away with a great set of tools for how to analyze film and how to trust what you see, not what you expect to see.","We saw some phenomenal movies in this course! Raoul Walsh is a great director who is worth studying in depth, especially since he toys with so many different genres. Tom is a wonderful and kind teacher, and the class atmosphere is relaxed but also conducive to some interesting and creative discussions and work.","Tom is an amazing professor and had so much passion for this class! I enjoyed the material and it truly gave me a new perspective on cinema.","This class served as a very exciting and fun introduction into the (dense) world of director Raoul Walsh. The films we watched were extremely rare and therefore I felt very lucky to be seeing some of the prints. It was nice to have a class working in tandem with the HFA. That said, the course is disorganized and the lectures can be jumbled. You have to take that in stride if you decide to enroll, and just be warned... no class or film screening will start on time.","great class taught by a great professor","Pleasure to take a class with Tom Conley! The films were amazing to watch.  Great intro the world of autership and film."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.31","workload":"1.69","difficulty":"2.46","recommendation":"4.38","enrollment":"17","response rate":"76.47","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 183","course_id":"5231","cat_num":"71745","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 183","course_id":"5231","cat_num":"71745","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 183","course_id":"5231","cat_num":"71745","1s":"6","2s":"5","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
