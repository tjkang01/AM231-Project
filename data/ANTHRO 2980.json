Be prepared for a good amount of work and reading, with weekly (1 page) assignments, coupled with 3-4 longer essays.  But, should you complete the course, you will come away with a broad and critical understanding of some of anthropology's central questions and debates, as well as a sense of the direction in which it is currently heading.  Highly recommended.","This course offers a strong foundation in cultural anthropology, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to understand\/engage in the dialogue of anthropological theory."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.57","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.57","recommendation":"4.57","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 2980","course_id":"244","cat_num":"1114","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 2980","course_id":"244","cat_num":"1114","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 2980","course_id":"244","cat_num":"1114","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
