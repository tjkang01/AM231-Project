This will change how you (do or don't) make value judgments about your art and others'.","Directed Research is its own thing.  Each weekly meeting consists of two hour-and-a-half presentations of students' work.  Each student makes two of these throughout the semester.  The presentations can take any form.  Sometimes they are fascinating and sometimes vapid.  Feedback from the instructors attempts to be purely interpretive.  Negative assessments of work are not stated outright and are very difficult to perceive, but do occasionally occur in a veiled manner.  The descriptive style can  be useful, but requires great dedication on the part of the student, for the student-instructor relationship is one between an energetic producer and a trained reactor.  If the student does not care to repeatedly provoke the reactions of the trained reactor, the conversation deteriorates.  If you take this course you should be interested in dedicating a lot of time and energy to creative ventures.  Do not take this course for just to get more credit.  Your classmates will resent you for it.","This class is a great opportunity to develop your artistic practice in an environment that invites you to create your own constraints but refuses to impose prescriptive ones of its own.","a good opportunity to pursue independent creative projects for course credit"]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Cool to see the very different kinds of work peers are producing","I would recommend it to take if you have an specific intellectual interest you would like to explore","Complete freedom, which is awesome. Less feedback, more discussion\/questioning, which can be helpful or frustrating depending on what you're looking for, but you can always guide the discussion to best meet your needs. Prina and Ryan are cool and helpful.","amazing class","TAKE IT!","Don't take this class if you have no idea what you want to do! Both in terms of artistic and technical direction, Stephen will not give you a ton of guidance or evaluation, but that is the point of the class. Stephen has a truly unique perspective on art and the art world, and it's so worth understanding that perspective. The absolute freedom in this class is also a plus. Feedback will largely depend no the quality of your peers and how engaged they are with the class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"7.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"12","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 96R","course_id":"5184","cat_num":"119636","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 96r","course_id":"5184","cat_num":"7299","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 96R","course_id":"5184","cat_num":"119636","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
