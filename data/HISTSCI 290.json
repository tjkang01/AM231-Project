There are no other courses at Harvard in which you are given such freedom to deal with a Harvard Collection.","If you work well with your group and are interested in the subject matter you were assigned, this can be a very interesting and rewarding class. Still, it is disorganized and much of the learning you do will have be self-initiated, don't expect to learn that much in the classroom.","Be patient and get to know the department's curatorial staff early on in the process.","Great class led by two great minds.
