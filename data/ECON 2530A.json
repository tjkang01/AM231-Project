This is a (great) theory course.","I feel like I learned a lot, although there are a couple of very practical reasons not to take this course\r\n- lectures are too early (8:30am!)\r\n- no TA, no chance to get help with the material\r\n- 100% final exam means if you have a bad day you're in trouble","Try to get ahead with reading, since there's a lot of ground covered at the end of the course.","Prof. Helpman is a fantastic teacher.

The problem sets can be tough, but they are useful. Do the readings on time.","Elhanan is an incredible teacher. He has a very comprehensive way of covering the trade literature. It was a pleasure to have him as a teacher although I found trade to be quite dry.","Very good course covering many important areas in trade and applied micro more generally.
