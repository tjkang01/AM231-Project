Discussion of topics you would not ordinarily come across in your field of study improves general knowledge about the earth sciences...and also links across fields. \r\nClass presentations are typically informative, but it is frustrating that discussion seems to get stuck for considerable periods on one small topic which can straddle the line between informative and unproductive.","The course offers a fairly broad survey of Earth science. It is a good way to appreciate many areas, the discussions are always interesting. Thinking about what makes good science is a worthwhile endeavor, and this course is a great way to do this.","A great way to get introduced to a variety of earth science topics.","This course is an interesting introduction to a range of topics in the Earth Sciences, with a fascinating consideration of the history and philosophy of science."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This class is fantastic. Eli is an extremely gifted professor, you learn a lot, and it has a manageable workload.","It's a great way to be exposed to new disciplines in Earth Science and to hone your discussion\/debate skills in a scientific context.","you can sound smart about the earth sciences about this class\r\nit teaches a lot of soft skills, like comprehending technical writing, writing a one-page response (which requires organising your thoughts and framing them)","Allow yourself reasonable time to read the papers and really think about them. You can get away with doing cursory readings, but do yourself a favor and be thorough--you'll definitely learn a lot. Also, when giving a presentation, start early.","Good reading class.
