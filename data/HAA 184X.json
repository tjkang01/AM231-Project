Prof. Kim will give you a solid foundation of how painting developed from early Buddhist, Jain and Hindu manuscripts to the flowering of exquisite Mughal and Rajput miniatures.  And, if like me, you are interested in contemporary Indian art then this course is indispensable to understanding and tracing underlying themes all the way to today's works.  Highly recommend the class!!!","This is a great course and Professor Kim is a very effective teacher who consistently gives honest and solid feedback. The course is a lot of work, but she makes it fun and engaging. I learned so much this semester."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"6.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"6","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 184X","course_id":"12459","cat_num":"156274","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 184X","course_id":"12459","cat_num":"156274","1s":"2","2s":"7","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
