Sometimes I had trouble following along, but overall got quite a bit out of the class.  This class was not based on assignments.","The course is aimed at postdocs and grad students already in NMR labs. Many postdocs audit the course, and the teaching is aimed at advanced NMR users. The focuses on the physics of NMR (pulse sequences, quantum mechanics of nuclear spins). Few biological applications are discussed, and there is no hands-on\/laboratory component of the course. The course feels disorganized because there are so many different instructors. The homework was not assigned frequently enough and was not difficult enough to provide you enough practice to master the material. This course is not self-contained; courses in quantum mechanics and upper-level E&M are a must for understanding the material.","I would only recommend this course to students interested in doing NMR in their research. The course is designed for students \/ postdocs in the NMR labs. Its not really meant to be taken by anyone else."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.00","workload":"1.00","difficulty":"2.33","recommendation":"2.00","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"BCMP 228","course_id":"2946","cat_num":"3969","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"BCMP 228","course_id":"2946","cat_num":"3969","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"BCMP 228","course_id":"2946","cat_num":"3969","1s":"3","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
