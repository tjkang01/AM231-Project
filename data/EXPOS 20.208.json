However, she does it in such a rude, personal manner that you feel awful the whole process. I'm sure you can find another expository writing class that both helps you improve and does so in a fun way.","Great expos course. The preceptor provides very useful feedback. The readings can be a bit boring at times so make sure the topic of the course interests you before taking the class.","It's a lot of peer editing. A lot more than other expos classes. Also, having homework every day is not very helpful.  I'd rather have a lot due once or twice.","Although you will learn about making your essay clear and countering counterargument to your essay, class time itself is rarely helpful for improving my writing.  Comments given were often contradictory and led me in the wrong direction or no direction at all.  Going to office hours and emailing Justine a lot helps.  The readings for the class are redundant and largely pointless.","It is a reading-light expos class, and you learn a lot about different forms of academic writing. Beware of art though, if you have never written about art before.","The preceptor is great at helping you revise your essays, and at having students learn from each other's efforts. I don't think my writing noticeably improved in the course.","Preceptor De Young can be very tough and vague about what she wants, and on a personal level she sometimes seems a little off-putting. She will improve your writing, though, and her grading is fair and extremely thoughtful. Working with her can be daunting, but it will pay off.","It is a lot of work and too many assignments per week but I think it is very rewarding in terms of learning and learning in Expos is essential because this course applies to all of your current and future courses.","DO not expect it to be easy. But very interesting."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.55","workload":"3.09","difficulty":"3.73","recommendation":"3.64","enrollment":"13","response rate":"84.62","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.208","course_id":"1740","cat_num":"64049","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"6","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 20.208","course_id":"1740","cat_num":"64049","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"6","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.208","course_id":"1740","cat_num":"64049","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"7","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
