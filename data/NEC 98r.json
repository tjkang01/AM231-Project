Professor Harris is also very helpful when it comes to answering questions and concerns and I hope he teaches the class next year."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["You must have a strong sense of self-motivation in order to stay on top of research, especially considering the fact that there is no actual classroom.","You can't choose whether or not to take it, so make sure to find a reader that will allow you to research what you want to do."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"NEC 98r","course_id":"3858","cat_num":"2612","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"NEC 98r","course_id":"3858","cat_num":"2612","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"NEC 98r","course_id":"3858","cat_num":"2612","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
