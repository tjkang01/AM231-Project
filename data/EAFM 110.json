If you are a fan of East Asian films and popular culture yourself, and want to learn more about how things exactly work in the industry, I recommend that you take this course!","Take it. Best introduction to film and East Asian film I could have asked for. Awesome professor.","An awesome class that doesn't require too much extra time commitment but one where you will also learn a lot; movie screenings feature diverse movies from all over East Asia that cover various production contexts, genres, and styles","Professor Zahlten is amazing. I'm glad to take this course even just because I could meet him.","This is a very interesting class that explores East Asian culture through a larger transnational cultural context.  The class covers Taiwanese, Japanese, and Korean film and culture,and attempts to reveal how the cultural flows between these countries.  Unfortunately, because the class has so much ground to cover in so little time, the class is somewhat disorganized and it is difficult to keep track of what we are studying.","It's a very fun course, but also informative in unexpected ways; I think all the students developed a different outlook on how media industries interacted internationally.","Take this class! It is the best class I've taken at Harvard thus far. The professor really knows his stuff and you learn to look at film in a completely different way. The weekly screenings are a bit annoying, but the films are pretty interesting and you probably would never come across them on your own. Recommend with all the enthusiasm I could possibly recommend a class with!","This course is designed for anyone who is interested in east Asian media culture. You would also get exposed to film terminology and analysis. I enjoyed attending every lecture of the course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"2.40","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"16","response rate":"68.75","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EAFM 110","course_id":"1834","cat_num":"64089","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EAFM 110","course_id":"1834","cat_num":"64089","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EAFM 110","course_id":"1834","cat_num":"64089","1s":"3","2s":"7","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
