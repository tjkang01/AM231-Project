Makes you think in new ways. It's really great.","Best class of my semester, and definitely among my top three classes at Harvard overall. The texts read, both literary and theoretical, will blow your mind and reorient your relationship with literature. At least that was true in my case. Also, the opportunity to meet with the poets we were reading in class was unreal. Such a treat. Lastly, I should note that the class was also particularly enjoyable because the five students in it all really gelled well together before the class had begun (having taken other classes together previously), so that may not necessarily be recreated the next time this course is taught, but Professor Sergio is amazing regardless, so if you're interested in poetry\/multi-media art making, take this.","Such a unique class - even though I am not particularly interested in poetry I really enjoyed learning about poetry translation\/transcreation. The symposium with the poets was such an incredible experience and by far the best part of the course. Just be prepared to spend the entire weekend preparing for it independently."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SPANSH 158","course_id":"11133","cat_num":"36194","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SPANSH 158","course_id":"11133","cat_num":"36194","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SPANSH 158","course_id":"11133","cat_num":"36194","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
