If you have little experience with Joyce or Beckett and want to get at the substance of what their respective works, you will find this course frustrating.","To those without antecedent experience with _Ulysses_ , be warned: you will be largely on your own when it comes to the nuts and bolts of how to read this expansive text.","Hard to predict whether any group will come to a class with a lot of enthusiasm, but maybe the difficulty of these texts raises the possibility that people will in effect just sit it out.","Avoid. Read Joyce and Beckett on your own time.","If you like Joyce and Beckett going in, and if you want practice at the genres of modern scholarship, I would recommend the course. If you don't like those authors going in, I don't think this course will change your views."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"2.80","workload":"6.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.00","enrollment":"14","response rate":"42.86","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 261","course_id":"1548","cat_num":"95885","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 261","course_id":"1548","cat_num":"95885","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 261","course_id":"1548","cat_num":"95885","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
