If you are just okay with political theory, like me, take it for Professor Beerbohm. Its readings are difficult, but there aren't too many of them, so it's not a brutal workload.","Professor Beerbohm is a wonderful teacher and person! I really enjoyed working with him and he was very accessible outside the classroom. The class leans a bit more toward ethics and theory than concrete policy, so keep that in mind as you make class decisions. As long as you're okay with that, I would definitely recommend the course!","Professor Beerbohm is one of the nicest and most helpful teachers I've had the privilege to learn from. Make sure you read over the syllabus because the seminar won't be a survey course, and focuses on some specific themes."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"4.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"9","response rate":"44.44","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
