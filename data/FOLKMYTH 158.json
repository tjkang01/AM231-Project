Ruth is an absolute gem - she deeply cares about students' wellbeing, interests, and academic growth, and she makes sure that class conversations are both relaxed and intellectually stimulating. She is invested in \"decolonizing the syllabus,\" so students have a hand in choosing course materials and making sure the syllabus captures a wide array of marginalized voices.","TAKE THIS CLASS. Ruth is absolutely incredible and will change the way you think about the world. The amount of reading is reasonable and the assignments are very open-ended so you can focus on a final paper\/project that interests you.","If you have a chance to take a class with Ruth Goldstein, absolutely take it, even if its not this class. She is wonderful, engaging, thoughtful, and kind in a way that few professors you will ever have is. Taking a class with her will be a completely different kind of educational experience that can actually be healing rather than stress-inducing. She opened my eyes to so many new ways of thinking and connecting seemingly disparate topics."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
