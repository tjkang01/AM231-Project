Regardless, if Lizzie is still the professor and you will have a nice small class format try to take the course!  It was an incredible opportunity to chat in depth about conservation with a mix of interesting and passionate students (undergrad as well as grad).  Lizzie also really knows her stuff, and brings in lots of interesting facts and experiences to the conservation :)  If you're interested in conservation at all, this is a must-take course at Harvard!","A fun and easy survey of some student selected topics in conservation biology, lots of opportunity to share thoughts but not much different than a typical seminar course","This was a really fun and interesting class. You really get a chance to delve into the heart of the issues.","I'd tell students that this class is definitely worth taking for the quality of the discussion, balanced by the relatively light reading and workload.","This is a wonderful course to learn about conservation. You will have a lot of freedom to learn about topics of your choice. However make sure you put in the effort to participate in discussions"]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This was a great class with very interesting material. I would highly recommend everyone that is all interested in conservation to take this class. I learnt a great deal in this class and am definitely a more well rounded individual at the end of the semester","Great class! Low workload and interesting discussions on a wide variety of conservation topics.","This course is great if you have a somewhat strong interest in conservation. If not, then you may find yourself bored."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"4.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"OEB 216","course_id":"12807","cat_num":"156660","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"OEB 216","course_id":"12807","cat_num":"156660","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
