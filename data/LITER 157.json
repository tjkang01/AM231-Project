Professor Giron is so extremely intelligent, eloquent and knowledgeable, he knows probably 20 languages and loves reading the texts in their original languages, which is awesome.  There isn't much discussion in class, which isn't bad because hearing him talk and teach is extremely enlightening.  The readings a really interesting and worth doing!","This course has a fairly heavy reading-load, at least in its first part.
