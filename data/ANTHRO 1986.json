Lucien is incredibly nice , but he has a distinct political position wrt text, teaching and academia. It feels like he does not really want to be an educator and loathes the classroom. As a result he throws an unbearable number of very difficult texts at us , expects us to read them and then gives us his opinion about them in 3 minutes. It was evident that a large number of students did not read the books and a lot were googling them on wikipedia as we spoke. Lucien did not tighten the reins and did not ask them to speak their opinions and did not moderate conversation..other than reflecting questions addressed to him back at students. I could have read the texts on my own and still got the same from the class. Again, I like Lucien and think he is incredibly intelligent and perhaps this is just not what he wants to teach or maybe he doesn't want to teach at all.","it is a great mixture of dense readings, good discussion of those dense readings, and hearing visiting artists present on their work","This is a challenging but rewarding class. The small format allows for deep discussion and fosters intellectual debate. The makers and writers invited to the class are incredible resources, a privilege few students get in larger classes. The community that gets formed around the intellectual issues raised makes one feel like they are having a fruitful discussion with a group of friends."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This course is for students who have begun significant media-based work on their own. It is crit-based and thus is best as a sounding board for you to gain useful feedback form your classmates and the professor."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.75","workload":"1.75","difficulty":"2.50","recommendation":"4.75","enrollment":"11","response rate":"36.36","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 1986","course_id":"180","cat_num":"3844","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 1986","course_id":"180","cat_num":"3844","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 1986","course_id":"180","cat_num":"3844","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
