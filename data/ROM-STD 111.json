Tom is easygoing when it comes to assignments and values independent thinking.","Take this class if you are looking for a low-stress elective. Professor Conley is a very nice man and laid back. He is also quite different from other professors and someone you should probably meet before leaving Harvard. The films and directors chosen are very interesting; taking this class will change how you look at any film following the course. However, if you are not a VES person or well-versed in film, the class can be very confusing, seem totally abstract and lacking in any sort of organization.","This course has a fabulous selection of movies. It really allows you to delve into studying some of the true classics - Renoir, Vigo, Fellini, Bunuel. Really changed my perspective as a film viewer. The class is relaxed but informative and, even if you're not a film student, is a good choice for an elective. Tom is absolutely lovely - you should always jump at a chance to take a course with him.","this is a great course and professor Conley is a great professor. I am only hesitant about recommending because taking this course in a small setting made it that much better.","Great course that looks at really interesting materials but be prepared to be mostly on your own.","You're not a fully actualized human being until you've seen new-wave cinema.","Really fun class! You get to watch some amazing movies, and it's a pleasure to spend time with Professor Conley."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.42","workload":"1.50","difficulty":"2.58","recommendation":"4.75","enrollment":"13","response rate":"92.31","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ROM-STD 111","course_id":"4468","cat_num":"73327","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ROM-STD 111","course_id":"4468","cat_num":"73327","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ROM-STD 111","course_id":"4468","cat_num":"73327","1s":"7","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
