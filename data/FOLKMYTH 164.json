The only annoying thing was the time (Fridays from 10-1 but actually more like 10-12 on most days). There were snacks at every class. (One time we consumed an entire box of thin mints. All 4 of us. It was great.) If you have any interest in exploring insult culture\/insult rituals, take the class. The way it worked was that we would each do some readings, and then present our notes and discuss them. There was no way to secretly fall behind, since the class was so small."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"3","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FOLKMYTH 164","course_id":"10789","cat_num":"75065","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FOLKMYTH 164","course_id":"10789","cat_num":"75065","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FOLKMYTH 164","course_id":"10789","cat_num":"75065","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
