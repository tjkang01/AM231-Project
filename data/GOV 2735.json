While the individual methods themselves are not engaged in depth, it does demonstrate how to effectively critique methods papers."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["It's not that much work and you do learn a lot about the different models that people do use. Unfortunately I was not very impressed with the general state of the field. It is extremely hard to show causal inference with the type of data we have available, and all the models we do use come with serious caveats. On the other hand it was valuable for me to go through a bunch of papers and come to this conclusion.","This is a hard class, only take it if you know you can handle it!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"9","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 2735","course_id":"2292","cat_num":"9499","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 2735","course_id":"2292","cat_num":"9499","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 2735","course_id":"2292","cat_num":"9499","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
