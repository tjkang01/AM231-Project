This was a fantastic course-one of the best I've taken at Harvard. If you are interested in learning modern Chinese history, which is really interesting, this course is a perfect candidate. Great discussions. Great books.","THIS IS AN AMAZING CLASS.","I am so sad that Prof. Muscolino is heading back to Georgetown. This has possibly been my favorite class throughout my time at Harvard. He was not only well-organized and committed, but also seemed to possess an exhaustive knowledge of Chinese history. Before entering this class, I had little to no knowledge about China's modern history, but now I feel as if I have a good grounding in the material. If Prof. Muscolino ever returns to Harvard, take this class!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.83","workload":"2.33","difficulty":"2.67","recommendation":"4.67","enrollment":"9","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1628","course_id":"2441","cat_num":"11666","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1628","course_id":"2441","cat_num":"11666","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1628","course_id":"2441","cat_num":"11666","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
