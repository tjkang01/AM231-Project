Definitely worth a semester for the curious. I found that it really enhanced my understanding of Modern English.","Professor Rozenski is a fantastic professor, and you can feel his English background flow throughout the class: the focus not merely in learning Old English, but in interpreting Old English literature and discussing the theory of translation. The class is noticeably relaxed, but in such a way that you can put effort into your translations, and produce a polished, well-crafted product. Indeed, this class offers a rare opportunity to be taught by a teacher who relishes your thoughts and interpretations, and willingly offers you opportunities to share your work with the rest of the academic community. Professor Rozenski is one of the kindest, most cheerful professors at Harvard, lighthearted, funny, and has a great sense of style. And he is also a great friend, and a valued one.","You'll get out what you put in. Be prepared to push yourself outside of class. Don't get through without actually memorizing lots of paradigms. German would be immensely helpful.","There is a great deal of translation in this class, especially towards the end of the semester. Plan accordingly."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"2.40","recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"10","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 102b","course_id":"10756","cat_num":"27448","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 102b","course_id":"10756","cat_num":"27448","1s":"2","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 102b","course_id":"10756","cat_num":"27448","1s":"2","2s":"6","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
