The discussions are friendly, and the instructor's knowledge provides a great basis for getting a good understanding for the field.","This subject is entirely opaque. It's tough, but for undergrads interested in taking a course on something very specific in a heavily researched field, it's a great class.","Arkhat is fantastic, well worth taking a class with.
