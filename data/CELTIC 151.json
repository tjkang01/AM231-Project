The course isn't too much work, and the discussions alone make the readings worth doing.","Although the topics and literature are fascinating and entertaining on their own, it's Professor McKenna's presence that makes the class so enjoyable. She fascilitates excellant discussions and she knows all of the material so well she can speak to any comment or question about the period in general beyond the assigned texts with great specificity and insightfulness.","This is a wonderful class to take if you want a relaxed, quirky class.  The readings are very diverse and interesting, and Professor McKenna is potentially the best professor I have had at Harvard.  The class is usually small, so there is some discussion back and forth."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Dr. Mckenna is such a gifted scholar and teacher and, yet, is exceptionally gracious and humble.","Great class taught by a great professor. The material is interesting and not at all what you would expect, and is actually a lot of fun to read and discuss. Assignments are low stress too, which is fun. Learned a ton too.","Very enjoyable study of Celtic hagiography with a wonderful professor!","This class is phenomenal if you are interested in the content.","This is a really fun class.  Saints' lives are entertaining to read, the workload is very manageable, and Professor McKenna is absolutely wonderful.  That being said, don't take this class unless you plan on doing the reading, because much of the class is discussion-based, and the room feels awkward if no one talks.  Though really, how could you not do the reading?  Some saints' lives are hilarious.","This is a fascinating course and the material is always surprising and refreshing. Professor McKenna is a great resource and extremely helpful. This course is not designed to be too difficult, so what you get out of it will be what you put into it. It definitely offers a perspective on Celtic culture that I would not have otherwise been exposed to."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.73","workload":"1.91","difficulty":"2.36","recommendation":"4.55","enrollment":"14","response rate":"78.57","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CELTIC 151","course_id":"445","cat_num":"5560","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CELTIC 151","course_id":"445","cat_num":"5560","1s":"1","2s":"6","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CELTIC 151","course_id":"445","cat_num":"5560","1s":"3","2s":"6","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
