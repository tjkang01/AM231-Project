'10":{"comments":["This class is great in introducing one to the spectrum of Slavic literature.  It also gives one the opportunity to improve one's writing in a small and welcoming setting.","This course was a nice, solid launch into the Slavic department.  I enjoyed that it drew on works from outside the canon, as it helped to broaden my familiarity with other slavic literary traditions and also meant that I got to read things I had never read before.  It is also nice to get to know the fellow sophomore concentrators, and to create a place to bounce ideas and interpretations off one another.","I think it is a great class.  I would just like to see some more readings in Russian.","It turns out Slavic Literature does not just mean Russia--take this course and find out how wonderful Czech, Polish, Lithuanian, Uzbek, South Korean, and Spanish literature can be. (Note: only real literature included.)"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["You will be reading a short novel every week and writing a one to three page paper on various topics.   There seems to be a dominance of Czech works.","It was awesome. Take it even if you aren't a slavic concentrator.","A lot of the writings we looked at were amazing and definitely worth reading.","Definitely take it if you have any interest in Russian\/Slavic literature!  Not a ton of reading, and almost all of it is really interesting (doesn't feel like you're reading for a class).  While 2 hours seemed like a long time for the discussion sometimes, it did go by quickly and I always left feeling I had learned something new or had a handle on the book we were reading for the week.  Your ability to read analytically and write WILL improve after taking this class."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["Daria is an absolutely amazing professor. This course is a phenomenal opportunity to learn from and discuss with her in a tutorial setting.
