Take this course if you're looking to get better at reading and discussing scientific papers! The final assignment involves writing a review, another extremely useful exercise.","This course is an incredible opportunity to have detailed discussions about both classic and contemporary literature on adaptation led by two great professors!","Each week we discussed three papers on a variety of interesting topics in evolutionary biology and genetics. Our discussions were relaxed and engaging, and the term paper was a nice open-ended opportunity to write on a topic of interest. Jim, Robin, and Nicole were all wonderful at guiding our conversations, offering interesting ideas, and providing feedback for the term paper.","For those generally interested in natural selection and adaptation, it's a great way to expand the scope of your reading and engage in interesting discussions about key concepts in evolutionary biology."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"9","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"OEB 278","course_id":"11073","cat_num":"0732","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"OEB 278","course_id":"11073","cat_num":"0732","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"OEB 278","course_id":"11073","cat_num":"0732","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
