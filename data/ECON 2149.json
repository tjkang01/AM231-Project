It helps you \"look into the black box\" of what the computer's estimation solver algorithms are actually doing.","Although these computational techniques are often represented as a useful toolkit for IO research, the content taught in this course are useful for many areas of economic research, and in my opinion they will become increasingly important over the coming years. This course is currently the only Harvard offering that teaches these techniques, so I would highly recommend it for students interested in applied micro, macro, structural models, econometrics, and public finance.","Just take this course."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This is an excellent class if you have research ideas in mind which could make use of the tools covered here.  If not, you will not get as much out of it and may find other classes a better use of time.","This course is fairly specialized, and it seemed like people with more specific research questions tended to get more out of it. But it's actually extremely helpful for a wide range of areas, and is only becoming more so."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.10","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"9","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 2149","course_id":"1040","cat_num":"7236","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 2149","course_id":"1040","cat_num":"7236","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"7","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 2149","course_id":"1040","cat_num":"7236","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
