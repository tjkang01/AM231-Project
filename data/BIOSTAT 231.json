The course uses Casella and Berger's text, which is the standard in the discipline for this level course.  The homeworks and exams are challenging, but fair.

Judith is a clear lecturer once you get used to her style. The lectures were a good mix of theory and lots of examples. Section and hw gave more examples for you to play with.
