Worth taking in my opinion."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["The whole approach is great for would-be applied microeconomists, whatever the \"field.\" Less useful for other simply interested social issues (even though Fryer's attitude might be refreshing after some sociological rambling).","Roland is great but he over-promises.

Especially towards the end of class, since everyone else starts to neglect the readings at that point.  But, the class is definitely worth it, since these are topics that are very important.  You definitely leave the class feeling like there are ways for your research to have a positive impact on the world."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Since there's no review section, forming a regular study group with other students to review the material from the class (namely, the models) can be very helpful.","It's at 8AM, and you need to be sharp.
