It was awesome to take as a senior and bring together many of the things I had been studying in my undergrad years. I was at first slightly intimidated to be the only undergrad in the class, but with preparation in cell biology and immunology, I was well-prepared to get a lot out this class. The take-home exams were hard, take your time with them, and think about all the different directions that you could take the questions."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.17","difficulty":"3.33","recommendation":"4.17","enrollment":"10","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MICROBI 202","course_id":"3310","cat_num":"23632","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MICROBI 202","course_id":"3310","cat_num":"23632","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MICROBI 202","course_id":"3310","cat_num":"23632","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
