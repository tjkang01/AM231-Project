David Haig is everything you could ask for in an adviser-supportive, flexible, understanding, and brilliant. He really cares about his students and makes himself very available to help you with your research. Other students writing their theses met with their professors only occasionally. Professor Haig made time every week to discuss my progress and findings. I recommend this course with reservations only because it really is up to YOU how much you get out of this course. If you are certain you want to do a thesis, then I recommend it with tremendous enthusiasm. David Haig is the best thesis adviser you could have.","It's a great way to do research and know you'll have time for it.
