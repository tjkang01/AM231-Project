I enjoyed the discussion section.","I would recommend students to sign up in a small group with a friend or two. Because members of our small group knew one another we were more honest and engaged in our discussions, so we got much more out of it than if we were going through the motions  (which may be more likely with strangers).","It's required, but not too much effort.","It's a large waste of time.","It's not too bad."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["The class provides a forum to discuss ethical issues we face as scientists but does not adequately provide students with the tools to handle these issues.","NA this is required, Who cares if I recommend this.
