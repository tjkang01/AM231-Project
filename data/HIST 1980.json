Allan was an excellent facilitator and instructor, and kept the conversation relevant and going. The response paper per week can be v. rough on people just getting introduced to these topics, but this course definitely challenged me and changed my worldview.","This course is a really great introduction to analyzing transnational global capitalism and the possible politics that emerge from within that system. If the readings on the course syllabus interest you, then definitely consider taking this class, as it provides an environment to participate in a productive, open discussion about those subjects. There is a fair amount of reading, but it's all really helpful for discussion, so keeping up with the reading helps you get the most out of this course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"4.50","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1980","course_id":"10939","cat_num":"42189","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1980","course_id":"10939","cat_num":"42189","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1980","course_id":"10939","cat_num":"42189","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
