By replacing kinship with \"relatedness,\" we get at a much broader term in its scope and a much more analytically useful term in its potential to penetrate the reality of socio-political relationship among people in contemporary East Asia. Dr.Goldfarb is a natural anthropologist and is one of the best teachers with whom I have ever studied. Not only is she enthusiastic about the subject matter, but also energetic about teaching, and supportive in just about everything. She is always approachable and will always be there for you when you need her whether you have academic or personal issues. I have gotten so much out of this class and I would recommend it with enthusiasm to everyone. I think it should be a required class for all East Asian Studies and Anthropology concentrators!","Good course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.67","workload":"2.67","difficulty":"3.33","recommendation":"4.67","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 2602","course_id":"202","cat_num":"52706","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 2602","course_id":"202","cat_num":"52706","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 2602","course_id":"202","cat_num":"52706","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
