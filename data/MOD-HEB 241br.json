The course is a blast - you will get to watch interesting and relevant films from Israel that will teach you a lot about its culture and history. Irit teaches with sensitivity, enthusiasm, knowledge, and personality.","Take it if you're confident with your (fluent) Hebrew and would like the opportunity to discuss practical and high-minded subjects in Hebrew. The class is fun, and generally speaking, not terribly work-intensive. But I'd advise against taking it if your aim is to improve grammar or vocabulary; this seminar is geared toward more open-ended aims.","This class is fun and laid-back, you get to watch a variety of really interesting Israeli films, and Irit is fantastic!  There's also very little work."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["No better way to learn Hebrew, and no better teacher! The best way to learn is by having fun. I came out of this class stronger in Hebrew and with a better understanding of Israeli culture, and I really enjoyed the process!"]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This is really an excellent class. Professor Aharony is a wonderful teacher and truly cares about her students. She is interested in hearing the opinions of everyone in class, and she takes the time and effort to really try and improve your Hebrew while tailoring the class pace and her attention to your Hebrew level. Furthermore, she challenges and engages you to think about important issues and see things in ways you may not have thought about previously. The chosen films this semester addressed a variety of issues including youth in Israel, Zionism, and the Holocaust. Be prepared to see the occasional difficult, often very sad or upsetting film.","Don't hesitate! Irit is wonderful, and accommodating to students of different fluency levels.","Your Hebrew fluency will improve substantially over the course of the semester."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"1.50","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MOD-HEB 241r","course_id":"3840","cat_num":"6949","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MOD-HEB 241r","course_id":"3840","cat_num":"6949","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MOD-HEB 241r","course_id":"3840","cat_num":"6949","1s":"3","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
