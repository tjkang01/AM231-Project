Be ready to work hard. But this does not mean that this course is not fun. At some point, you will find yourself reading cuneiform signs and understanding the ancient texts. Amazing!"]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["If you want to do something challenging but rewarding, take this class. You'll be reading some extremely old texts with relative competency within a year.","Akkadian is a fascinating language to learn, and cuneiform is an amazing system of writing that is really worth learning. That's the issue, though - in some ways, those are two separate topics, and two separate skill sets are necessary to learn them. Switching between image recognition and syntax\/grammar recollection can be challenging. By all means take this class, but I'd suggest you ask Jae-Hwan - who is very knowledgeable, extremely patient and a total sweetheart - to designate the two class meetings as separate sections, in a way, one for cuneiform (reading, transliteration, normalization), and one for language (grammar, syntax, translation). Things may go much faster, and be more productive for your learning, that way. Also, ask for more review of the grammar and syntax generally; the course seems to assume that you're doing that on your own, but it can be really challenging sometimes to keep your mind on all of the similar-looking verb conjugations."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"8.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AKKAD AB","course_id":"13501","cat_num":"159801","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"AKKAD AB","course_id":"13501","cat_num":"159801","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
