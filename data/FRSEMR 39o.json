Very easy and brings an interesting perspective to children't literature and young adult fiction.","It is a fun class that helps you explore writing and literature in a discussion-based, open-minded way","This is an extremely fun class. If you want to share your love for your favorite childhood books with other students, this is the class to take!","This class is FANTASTIC. Totally recommend it... The readings are the best, and the professor is so good and facilitates really fascinating discussions. The group dynamic is so great - how can you NOT be in a good mood when you're talking about Peter Pan and Harry Potter?!","This class was so much fun and it enhanced my writing skills.","This class was wonderful. Professor Gustafson is great, and the discussion was always very interesting.","This class is a fun and unstressful way to delve into material (children's literature) with which you are familiar but have not studied academically.","Incredibly interesting, great discussions, fun and relaxing way to study children's literature!
