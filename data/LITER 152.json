It was very interesting and enjoyable and there was basically no work at all. Also, Professor Nagy is wonderful!","To future students, do as much reading and explore every subject further than what you only discuss in class, further exploration will enlighten you."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.71","workload":"1.14","difficulty":"1.71","recommendation":"4.71","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LITER 152","course_id":"615","cat_num":"52781","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LITER 152","course_id":"615","cat_num":"52781","1s":"3","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LITER 152","course_id":"615","cat_num":"52781","1s":"6","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
