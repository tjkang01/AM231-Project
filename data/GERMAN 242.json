Professor Hamilton ended up lecturing much of the time, but I found those days the most fruitful. German, Latin, and ancient Greek are not necessary but helpful - most readings are translated to English. I'd highly recommend this course for anyone interested in ancient Greek art or philosophy.","This is a great opportunity to learn about the importance of the interactions between Greek and German culture as well as the reception history of the Greeks in Germany. If you are not familiar with German or Greek, it might benefit you to review some basic vocabulary and grammar before beginning the class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"7.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
