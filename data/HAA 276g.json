The mixture of students from different departments and backgrounds made for a very dynamic course.","Dear prospective HAA276g,\r\nThis course is amazing. Prof. Lambert-Beatty is amazing (read: extremely kind, supportive, and enthusiastic to share her wisdom). You literally have NO reason whatsoever, NOT to take it. At first, I was a little bit worried that student presentations took up too many of the weeks, and that we would not be able to cover much theoretical ground... (In the second half of the semester, students conduct their own sessions according to their research interests.) We could have done with more \"concept\" weeks, but due to the variety of grad students (HAA, VES, RLL [French and Spanish], Music), the student presentations (and the concluding symposium) turned out to be wonderfully interesting and theoretically engaging. Prof. Lambert-Beatty is \"the\" pioneer in the field, having influenced many with her \"Parafiction\" essay, so take a look at that, and if you fall in love with the topic (as I did), GO FOR IT!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.60","recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"10","response rate":"70.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 276g","course_id":"11397","cat_num":"65946","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 276g","course_id":"11397","cat_num":"65946","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 276g","course_id":"11397","cat_num":"65946","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
