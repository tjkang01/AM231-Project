Having dinner together as a class at the professor's home with him and his wife was a wonderful experience! In our final meeting, he told us how these four years will fly by and that we should suck the marrow out of our experience here. He said to feel free to contact him, as he felt he belonged to us. It was heartfelt and meant a lot to me.","This class is great! Take it! All of the books are really good and Bill Graham is both a good teacher and an amazing person.","A wonderful opportunity to read and discuss an interesting book each week under the guidance of a professor who is both insightful and warm.  Course work involves weekly 1-page response papers, leading class discussion twice, and writing 2 3-5 page papers.  Highly recommend!","I was surprised by this seminar. Having been rejected by the seminars I applied for both terms, I was at a bit of a loss... I signed up for this course on a whim, and boy am I glad that I did. Professor Graham is an absolute gem; this man deserves a medal. The books he chose us to read and discuss were outstanding, and several have been added to my list of favorites. Graham is a wonderful professor and ridiculously interesting dude with tons of neat stories and banks of information. Our class had to opportunity to take a journey of our own -- when we trekked with Prof. Graham up to his house and dined like royalty along with his wife. \r\n\r\nBottom line: if you like to read or you WANT to read, take this course. Check the syllabus to see if you've read any of the books. I hadn't read any of our texts and benefited a lot from them."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"1.70","difficulty":"2.30","recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 36p","course_id":"10817","cat_num":"95495","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 36p","course_id":"10817","cat_num":"95495","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 36p","course_id":"10817","cat_num":"95495","1s":"3","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
