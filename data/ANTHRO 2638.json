It *is* difficult if you don't have a background in politics or anthropology, but if you commit to the course and plough through the readings each week, you will learn a lot. Feel free to ask the 'stupid question' in class; Asad will always make you realize you asked something pertinent.","Be prepared to work hard on deciphering the readings and expect high-level discussion from your coursemates. Professor Ahmed is willing to help you understand the material, but you certainly have to reach out if you need it. A strong background in anthropology is highly recommended."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"4.00","recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"7","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 2638","course_id":"209","cat_num":"67859","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 2638","course_id":"209","cat_num":"67859","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 2638","course_id":"209","cat_num":"67859","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
