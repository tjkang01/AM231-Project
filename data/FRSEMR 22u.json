I recommend exploring some of Professor Berg's papers to see what will be discussed. You should have a strong background in physics. A large portion of the assigned readings are dense scientific papers that are difficult if you are unfamiliar with the format. Some of the highlights of the course were the tours of the lab and the guest discussion with Dr. Kelly Hughes.","This is an informative class about a very specific topic. Through it, I feel I am better prepared to read  primary source scientific journals as well as present information convincingly to small groups.","It is an interesting class, but it is not characteristic of a freshman seminar.","Professor Berg discovered much of what he's teach about -- which is unbelievable.  However, at times the style of the course was entirely lecture based, while in taking a freshman seminar I was hoping for something more discussion based.","This class helps you see a different side of biology that you're not used to covering in high schools. A bit of the equations were over my head, but it teaches you how to read scientific publications."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.40","workload":"1.30","difficulty":"2.30","recommendation":"3.30","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 22u","course_id":"10793","cat_num":"28895","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 22u","course_id":"10793","cat_num":"28895","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 22u","course_id":"10793","cat_num":"28895","1s":"5","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
