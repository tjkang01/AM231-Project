It's not particularly hard, though the research project is a good deal of work. This project can be very rewarding, though!","While slightly unorthodox due to the more lecture-based classes, it does still involve a lot of discussion and transitions very well into the classic \"seminar\" layout if anyone has questions about any of the slides. Tomasz is a super chill professor and is just as inquisitive if not more than you and your peers so all questions are great questions.","The material is interesting, and Tomasz is great.  I learned a lot and also enjoyed working through the design of an experiment for my final paper.","I think, as far as tutorials go, this was quite interesting. The research paper was very theoretical so was much easier to write than a data driven class. Tomasz is also a very nice guy, but is admittedly a boring lecturer. Tutorials in general are a great way to get through a writing requirement because they help you a lot along the way."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"4.90","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"11","response rate":"72.73","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
