The workload is very fair.","If you like discussion- and reading-based courses, as I do, you will greatly enjoy this class. The weekly workload (a considerable number of readings and a short response paper about the readings) is definitely manageable, and the two-hour discussions about the readings are very interesting. (Other than the weekly workload, the class includes a short online midterm and a final paper.)\r\n\r\nProfessor Lufkin genuinely loves the subject, which lends a great deal of enthusiasm to the class. I definitely recommend this course to anyone intrigued by tattoo!","There's a lot of reading but it's all so fascinating it's worth the hours that you put in. The historical roots are great but it's even cooler to read modern 20th century pieces and be able to make connections to something familiar from what's been read"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"3.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"10","response rate":"70.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FOLKMYTH 176","course_id":"13964","cat_num":"161297","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FOLKMYTH 176","course_id":"13964","cat_num":"161297","1s":"3","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
