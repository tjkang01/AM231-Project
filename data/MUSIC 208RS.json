It studies in depth exactly what it says it will, and delivers!","This class is a great opportunity to learn more about both ethnography and ethnomusicology on Africa.","This is a fantastic course for anyone working towards a primary research area in African music, as you will cover many of the relevant musical ethnographies from across the continent. It also gives you a chance to discuss the issues that come up in these books in class, and situate them in relation to your own work.","Very good survey of the essential literature, with a diverse reading list covering many parts of the continent and many types of genres. Shelemay is an excellent discussion leader and gives very useful feedback. A lot of reading, but worth it if you're interested in the material"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"8.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"5","response rate":"40.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MUSIC 208RS","course_id":"3672","cat_num":"108992","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MUSIC 208rs","course_id":"3672","cat_num":"44783","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MUSIC 208RS","course_id":"3672","cat_num":"108992","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
