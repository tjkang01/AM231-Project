Some quick brush-ups on Weimar German history might be useful.","This class requires a great deal of work--reading dense material and regularly trying to make sense of it. But if you have any interest in these scholars, it is well worth it.","Start quickly prioritizing - skip some of the reading to prepare your response paper or do research","Be prepared to read a huge amount (between 100-150 pages) of difficult theory texts. If you are interested in Frankfurt School and their media\/film theory, this course is definitely the right place. Prof. Rentschler is a great scholar who has immense knowledge about the very challenging material."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"15.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"6","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 289","course_id":"12741","cat_num":"156172","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 289","course_id":"12741","cat_num":"156172","1s":"2","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
