I think it served its purpose well by deeply engaging scientists in fundamental questions about nature with all their subtleties and helped us reflect on the strength and limitations of science in answering these questions. It also made us aware of the pre-conceptions we as the observer bring into every situation. It was particularly nice to spend time discussing the nature of various concepts we tend to deal with in mathematical models everyday but usually don't ponder on the big picture significance of.","This is a good class to discuss books or papers on evolutionary biology\/genetics with other grad students. John is good at identifying the points of greatest interest in a text.","If this version of Wakeley-seminar ever returns, take it."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["The class's focus seemed dauntingly narrow and required a much stronger background than I had in several areas, however simply being exposed to these topics was a good learning experience and one should not be frightened of entering a learning environment simply because they are lacking knowledge in that area","Take this class if it's offered. A relaxed and intimate setting to engage with difficult papers and discuss them with other students who have experience to contribute. I learned so much from this experience and it was a great opportunity to take a graduate seminar with incredible students. Prof. Wakeley is wonderful and the material is truly fascinating."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["The papers are great.
