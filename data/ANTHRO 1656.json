You get to grapple with a lot of big ideas about religion, politics, liberalism, secularism, and societal divisions. The amount of reading is manageable.","I would highly recommend any of Professor Ahmed's classes to students who are interested in studying South Asia. This course's material was very interesting and the readings were well selected to give insight into many different points of view about a week's topic.","For anyone interested in anthropology this is a perfect course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.86","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.43","recommendation":"4.17","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 1656","course_id":"154","cat_num":"16337","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 1656","course_id":"154","cat_num":"16337","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 1656","course_id":"154","cat_num":"16337","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
