If you enjoy pre-modern history or are curious to learn more about Vietnam before French Occupation, I highly recommend.","Prof. Tai is very well-versed in her field.

Interesting material and well taught."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["She is a fantastic professor who teaches with enthusiasm for the subject.  You will learn so much about a subject that you most likely do not know much about.","Excellent class to take as an elective if you're interested in history or for your concentration requirement. I took as an elective knowing nothing about Vietnam and learned an incredible amount about a very unique and interesting place. Piqued my interest to visit one day. Cool class I'd recommend as an elective for upperclassmen looking to take something they'll actually enjoy learning about.","Learn a lot about a history that isn't covered in traditional history classes.","Pay attention in class--very useful for the essays","This class was very relaxed and was a great choice as an elective.  The professor is awesome, really nice, and flexible about deadlines."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"3.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1619","course_id":"2437","cat_num":"4581","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1619","course_id":"2437","cat_num":"4581","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1619","course_id":"2437","cat_num":"4581","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
