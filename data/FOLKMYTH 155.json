However, it was interesting for me and provided me with lots of theoretical frameworks that I imagine I will use going forward.","For people interested in social justice and\/or the history of American reform movements, this class is a really cool opportunity to explore them from the new lens of folklore! I learned a ton about what folklore is (much broader than you might think) and how culture and cultural production have functioned in and supported movements for change. There is a TON of reading, but I'm hoping Leah will cut it down a bit for future offerings. Leah is knowledgable, enthusiastic, friendly, and encouraging!","The class has some really interesting material depending on how you engage with it","There's way too much reading and the discussions are not great. Leah is very sweet but sometimes not great at moving the conversation forward.","This is a really great and interesting course if you are interested in social justice! Just know that the readings are super long, which makes some discussions feel tedious as the professor is just trying to get us to remember what happened. Definitely do all the readings and put the time in and you'll get a lot out of this course!!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"3.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.60","enrollment":"11","response rate":"81.82","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FOLKMYTH 155","course_id":"13602","cat_num":"159987","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"7","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FOLKMYTH 155","course_id":"13602","cat_num":"159987","1s":"2","2s":"7","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
