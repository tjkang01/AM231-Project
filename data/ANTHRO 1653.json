I particularly appreciated how Professor Scott would bring in articles from newspapers and magazines about contemporary events, such as the meaning of Trump's simplified rhetoric or the power dynamics associated with using different greetings in a vice presidential debate. This an awesome course for learning some theory\/ concepts\/ terminology in linguistic anthropology that can be used directly to understand better how our political situation relates to language.","Interesting discussions and the workload is not that overwhelming. Discussions tend to lean more towards the politics side, as it is an anthropology course, but language is still important! Make sure to keep up with the readings.","It took me a while to figure out what this class was about and to define its key terms, but after I got some familiarity with the material I really appreciated the lens of interpretation it offered. Don't be afraid to ask basic questions in lecture, and try to ask for the take-away from every reading."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"4.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"7","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
