I would definitely recommend it for next year if you have any interest in prediction. It is pretty in depth-spanning from ancient techniques to modern simulation and the material is solid.","This is just a great class to take to learn a variety of interesting topics with not a lot of work","Really fun and interesting course. We discussed a wide variety of topics which kept it interesting all semester."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["This is a fun, non-stressful, and interesting freshman seminar.","There are more interesting ways to spend 1\/32 of your time here","Such a fun class!","I would tell them of the history dimension of the course as opposed to a focus on modern predictive systems.","This class is the best. The professor was so nice and personable. Going to this seminar made my Wednesday's something to look forward to. I loved getting to know the professor and my classmates in such a small environment. This course also opened up some really cool opportunities because the professor is helping head the creation of a new online Harvard course- so join the class and become a part of it!","This freshman seminar was so much fun. Each week felt as though we were meeting up for a dinner discussion rather than for an actual class and I personally really enjoyed learning about different models in finance, epidemiology, and astrophysics."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"1.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"11","response rate":"63.64","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 27J","course_id":"12873","cat_num":"156929","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 27J","course_id":"12873","cat_num":"156929","1s":"7","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
