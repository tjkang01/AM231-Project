The course was very interesting, and Andy is fantastic.","This course completely changed my path in grad school. Andy is a fantastic lecturer who really takes an interest in his students. I was always excited to come to class. You will be presenting at least 3 times throughout the semester (depending on the class size) but presentations are much more like informal discussions. It is really an amazing seminar course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"4.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"OEB 209","course_id":"3971","cat_num":"67224","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"OEB 209","course_id":"3971","cat_num":"67224","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"OEB 209","course_id":"3971","cat_num":"67224","1s":"2","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
