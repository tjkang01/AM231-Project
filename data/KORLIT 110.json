The course is very thoughtfully designed to cover a lot of materials, but with great depth, if you'd like. Professor Park is one in a million - you should take a class with her if you're at all interested in learning about Korea, but also she is so knowledgeable about Japan and China - a fantastic teacher all around."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"7.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"KORLIT 110","course_id":"12746","cat_num":"156592","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"KORLIT 110","course_id":"12746","cat_num":"156592","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
