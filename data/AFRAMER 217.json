The focus is on themes, rather than a more general historical review, however. The reading load is not light, but big questions and trends in theory are more the focus of discussions, rather than a detailed analysis of the texts.","Prof. Elkins is amazing! She is caring, insightful and a great discussion leader. She pushes to think outside of your comfort zone and ask and address the key questions in the field. That being said, the course had an English-speaking Africa bias and was too theoretic and methodological."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.80","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"10","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AFRAMER 217","course_id":"10646","cat_num":"42627","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AFRAMER 217","course_id":"10646","cat_num":"42627","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AFRAMER 217","course_id":"10646","cat_num":"42627","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
