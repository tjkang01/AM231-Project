Italian cinema is so fascinating and this class does a great job in going about discussing it. The workload is a bit more than you'd imagine, just because watching the movies and writing responses does take some time, but it's definitely all really interesting. Most definitely would recommend!","Learned more about the films that about migration."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.90","workload":"3.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"8","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ITAL 117","course_id":"13314","cat_num":"160610","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ITAL 117","course_id":"13314","cat_num":"160610","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
