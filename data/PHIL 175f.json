Seminar discussion overall was engaging and directed well, although some weeks were dull. I would have liked to have gotten more feedback, though.","Make sure you find the material engaging","Professor Shelby is wonderful and asks really interesting questions.  The family is a topic underexplored by philosophers and I'm really happy to have taken a class on it.","If you are looking for the rigor of a philosophy course and the practical relevance of a sociology or public policy seminar, this is the class for you. Professor Shelby is not only brilliant and a gifted discussion leader, but is also one of the only philosophy professors at Harvard doing work that has real impact on human lives. A clarification: this course doesn't ask, \"How should we parent?\" It asks questions like, \"WHY do parents have obligations to their children?\" I was super interested in the latter kind of question. If you are, too, then I highly recommend that you take this class.","The family is a neglected topic within philosophy, which made this class both refreshing and frustrating. It was intellectually rewarding to consider issues related to the family from the perspective of justice, though I could not help but be reminded of the limitations of the approaches we examined in adequately addressing many of the issues we looked at."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"3.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"9","response rate":"55.56","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHIL 175f","course_id":"12570","cat_num":"95839","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHIL 175f","course_id":"12570","cat_num":"95839","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
