You have to be fairly independent going in, but the class will accommodate every creative direction that you can bring to the table.","This course is wonderful.  Focusing on building a larger portfolio, we were able to explore the artwork WE wanted to create. Assignments were broad, allowing us to be open to new ideas.","Experiment with materials! If you know you do one thing well, try out other things. This class is supposed to challenge you and the expectation should be that as a moderately experienced drawer you can adapt and grow to different challenges. Take chances with assignments; drawing can be incorporated in various aspects of whatever you do.","Excellent, both Katarina and Sally are great. They push you to experiment while providing you with the support to do so. Would definitely recommend.","the class can be intimidating initially, but is a great experience overall","Take as many risks as possible; this is a great class for exploring medium and technique","I would say it's a lot of fun and you learn a lot but it is quite self directed.","This course is really wonderful and you can really start to develop a body of work and a voice as an artist, but it is completely dependent on how much you put into the class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"7.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"14","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 110R","course_id":"12732","cat_num":"156400","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 110R","course_id":"12732","cat_num":"156400","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
