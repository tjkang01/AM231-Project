Take this if you want a really light workload.","If you like ballet, it gives you a lot of good watching and reading material.  The actual class isn't great, though.","Take it. You will learn a lot with regards to the growth of ballet. The field trip is so much fun and the fact that is a freshman seminar graded PASS\/FAIL means there is less weight on your shoulders.","If you don't like ballet, and the idea of having to watch a recorded performance per week doesn't appeal to you, this is not for you. If that does sound fun, it's not too big of a time commitment, and the perspective is interesting.","This is an excellent way to learn a lot about ballet if you are enthusiastic about it. The workload is pretty light during the week: the assignments consist mostly of watching ballets, which can take up a few hours, and a few readings."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"2.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.50","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 39x","course_id":"12376","cat_num":"94012","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 39x","course_id":"12376","cat_num":"94012","1s":"2","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
