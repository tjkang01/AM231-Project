Professor Hamilton teaches it so well.  If you like to think deeply and if you like to read really good stuff, take this class!","Enjoy readings you've probably heard about, but have never picked up.  Enjoy also Professor Hamilton's interesting insights.","It's one of the more successful \"thematic courses\" (courses organized thematically rather than chronologically\/ geographically, etc.)","The readings were manageable and some were a bit bizarre but the class discussions and the professor makes the whole experience worthwhile.","Do the readings and participate, and it becomes a very enjoyable class.","This is a great course! Professor Hamilton is brilliant, but be prepared for him to lecture for the whole two hours. The work is enjoyable and not especially time-consuming."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"1.90","difficulty":"2.60","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"18","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LITERATURE 155","course_id":"618","cat_num":"7758","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"7","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LITERATURE 155","course_id":"618","cat_num":"7758","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"12","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LITERATURE 155","course_id":"618","cat_num":"7758","1s":"4","2s":"12","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
