Everything is free-form and improvised. The professor is an excellent mentor and provides individual attention to each student to realize his or her own improvisational goals.","This class changed the way I look as music, not only improvisation.","Prof. Levin has a staggering amount of knowledge and experience in classical music (especially mozart and bach and beethoven) and he can show through his master-style classes a myriad of different ways to improve\/make your improvisation more interesting and varied. Prof. Levin has high standards and is very kind and encouraging and non-judgmental; this attitude spreads to the rest of the classroom.  A very hands-on, broad-thinking class.  I learned and came to appreciate the architecture of many pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach.  I have a much greater respect for these composers, Prof. Levin, and anyone who successfully improvises now."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.75","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MUSIC 185r","course_id":"3650","cat_num":"72478","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MUSIC 185r","course_id":"3650","cat_num":"72478","1s":"3","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MUSIC 185r","course_id":"3650","cat_num":"72478","1s":"4","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
