Without a doubt, I am a better researcher, writer, and thinker for having taken this course. I cannot recommend it or Professor Claybaugh highly enough.","This is not a class for the faint of heart, nor a class to be taken as a fourth credit, but it might be the most useful course of your graduate career. Even if you don't study novels, or you study a century in which it seems impractical to talk about the bildungsroman, you should consider this class\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou'll learn so much about how to craft a good article and operate in the professional world, and you'll get really specific feedback from someone who has thought really critically about what academic writing about literature needs to do.\r\n\r\nMy only advice would be that it's helpful to come into the class with a novel you are already thinking about working on.
