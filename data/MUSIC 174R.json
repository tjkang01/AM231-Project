It's incredible to interact with him at all, let alone take a whole course taught by him!","This course is likely to change with each different instructor. Taking this course with Professor Lewis was very relaxing but a bit unstructured. The final concert at the end was very free-form though and very fun at the end. Whatever effort you put in, you get out.","I have no idea what this class is like when it is taught by Vijay Iyer, but with George Lewis it was somewhat of a disappointment. While Professor Lewis brought a kind atmosphere and a genuine enthusiasm to the class, the course lacked focus and organization. In addition, there was much less of an emphasis on performance than I had hoped: instead it felt more like a regular course in that we spent nearly all of our time on readings and abstract theoretical discussion. This is fine in moderation, but the class really suffered from its one-sidedness (too heavy on theory, not enough performance).","if you're into performance and music, then you already know you're taking this class.","Appropriate the content, it will definitely be worthwhile.","When taught with Professor Lewis, this course was extremely laid-back, a far cry from Professor Iyer's teaching style. It was very interesting, but extremely open-ended. If you are looking for something rigorous, this may not be it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"3.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.70","enrollment":"12","response rate":"58.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
