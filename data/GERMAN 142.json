It's really rewarding if you put in the work, but you have to check and make sure that the reading materials are ones that you will respond to for an entire semester, because reading only aphorisms can sometimes be heavy going.","Great variety of texts and topics.  Good discussions.  This class offered a good way to cover a broad range of German literature (Kleist, Goethe, Nietsche, Benjamin and Adorno within a single seminar).","This class is magnificent, or, to put more regularly, \"great stuff!\" Like many courses in the German Department, it includes a helpful professor, intellectual stimulating peers, and thought-provoking debates. Take it! The reading seems daunting at first, but is ultimately very manageable."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GERMAN 142","course_id":"2103","cat_num":"96052","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GERMAN 142","course_id":"2103","cat_num":"96052","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GERMAN 142","course_id":"2103","cat_num":"96052","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
