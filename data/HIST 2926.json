Professors Lewis and Jasanoff are really excellent professors--and are experts on empire--so it was a treat to have them in the same room."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This course provides a challenging but fruitful opportunity for students to critically and constructively reflect upon their general approaches to scholarly and pedagogical practice, all while gaining a useful introduction to the study of empires throughout history.","A great introduction to a number of important topics in imperial and global history.","Coming from a specialization outside of western Europe, I felt that this class gave me a good framework and foundation for understanding debates about imperial history going on in that particular area. I really found the assignments worthwhile and for that alone I think the course is worth taking.","It provokes extremely lively and engaging discussion in class, it provides concrete experience and instruction in pedagogy, and it offers a broad-reaching synthesis of world history from numerous competing perspectives. The readings are great."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"8.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"18","response rate":"61.11","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 2926","course_id":"2515","cat_num":"62429","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 2926","course_id":"2515","cat_num":"62429","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 2926","course_id":"2515","cat_num":"62429","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
