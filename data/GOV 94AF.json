Before you take it for this exact reason, double check with Bates.\r\nThis is mostly a History + Economics course. If you like Economics and have taken Ec10b, this will be easier for you. Remember to take a lot of notes during section because there is no online material except the readings. \r\nTalk with Bates about your essay. He is quite hard to get a hold of, because he didnt even give us his email so make a lot of efforts.","Interesting class and Bates really knows his information. This is a class that is pretty stress free until May when everything collapses into a paper and exam and you find yourself scrambling because you have no clue as to what can be asked of you.","Class has a lot of economics so it may be helpful to have a strong background there. Discussion is more interesting than the readings. Very back-loaded course, literally nothing until the final paper and the final","This course is incredibly informative and rewarding. As somebody who took it with absolutely no background in Africa, I learned a ton.","Complete the readings; otherwise, you'll walk away without having learned much. Overall, the course offers an economical\/historical approach to understanding state success and failure in Sub-Saharan Africa."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.90","workload":"6.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"12","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
