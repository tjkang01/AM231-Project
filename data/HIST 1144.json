The primary texts you read are great and their isn't too much reading per week.  Essays and midterms were graded very fairly.","This is an incredible course if you're interested in art, literature, and cultural flourishing more generally.","Prof. Hankins is an excellent professor, and the course is very interesting. It covers everything from art history to political thought and religious reforms that were occurring during the Renaissance.","Professor Hankins' History of the Renaissance in Florence class is a phenomenally interesting look into the history behind one of the great periods of artistic and cultural flourishing.  The teaching staff is excellent and the course readings are very interesting.  Sections are also very informative and enjoyable and Professor Hankins' incredible knowledge of the course material makes the lectures very interesting.","A great class if you have the chance to take it!  You will not regret being in this class.","The reading is a bit more than the syllabus indicates. Professor Hankins knows what he is talking about and gives great lectures."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.29","workload":"2.21","difficulty":"2.93","recommendation":"4.43","enrollment":"15","response rate":"93.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1144","course_id":"2396","cat_num":"4631","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"4","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1144","course_id":"2396","cat_num":"4631","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"11","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1144","course_id":"2396","cat_num":"4631","1s":"2","2s":"8","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
