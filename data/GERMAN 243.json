If you're interested in one of the most intriguing novels that influenced post-modernist narratives, this is your course.","This is a very well structured course. Prof. Ryan started to post the required reading two months before the beginning of the semester. If you are interested in Musil's extraordinary work, you should take this course. I would suggest to start to read the novel Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften and secondary literature posted by Prof. Ryan beforehand, so that you you could take more advantage of the very productive discussions."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"5.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"5","response rate":"120.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GERMAN 243","course_id":"13090","cat_num":"159642","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"GERMAN 243","course_id":"13090","cat_num":"159642","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
