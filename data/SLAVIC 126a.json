I would especially recommend it if you are continuing with Russian, or just starting (as long as at Slavic B level, but maybe even at A), because it would be most helpful. I took it as an outgoing senior doing nothing with Russian afterwards and not taking a concurrent Russian class, which made it harder to connect what I was learning into long-term memory.","If you have an interest in Russian linguistics, this course and Professor Flier and \"must haves.\" However, don't expect this course to dramatically improve your Russian language fluency - that is not the primary aim of the class.","In all fairness, I don't know how \"useful\" this class was for me. It was interesting, and particularly in terms of phonetics, I learned a lot about the pronunciation of Russian, something I hadn't expected when signing up. In the nominal and verbal morphology sections, however, it felt like we were learning how to read Prof. Flier's secret code and extrapolate it, which is fine, except that I have doubts about how widely applicable that knowledge will be to my future grasp of the language."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"1.50","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"3.00","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SLAVIC 126a","course_id":"4550","cat_num":"3083","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SLAVIC 126a","course_id":"4550","cat_num":"3083","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SLAVIC 126a","course_id":"4550","cat_num":"3083","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
