Professors de la Fuente and Akyeampong are both excellent, and their distinct teaching styles complement each other well. Due to the comparative nature of the course, they are both able to lend their expertise (either on the Americas or on Africa, as the case may be) to the wide range of topics discussed during the semester. One huge benefit of this course is that is gives you a great advantage over historians of slavery who just focus on one region (i.e. the United States, Latin America, Africa). Doing comparative work rather quickly reveals the shortcomings of many conclusions or methods that have gained currency in any one regional sub-field. Moreover, because the paper assignments are historiographical and not research-oriented, the class offers a great opportunity to reflect on the state of the field, identify necessary and fruitful research questions, and prepare for future oral exams."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"9.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 2707","course_id":"13381","cat_num":"159554","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 2707","course_id":"13381","cat_num":"159554","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
