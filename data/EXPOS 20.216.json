Take if: 1) you are interested in social science or science\/psychology and how people make decisions. 2) you do not want to read a lot and instead focus on writing skills as opposed to reading comprehension. 3) you actually want to learn good writing skills. Professor Tierney is great.","One nice thing about this class was that there was little reading.  This was helpful for putting emphasis on writing.  Professor Tierney was strict, but very nice and helpful.","This class is great if you are at all interested in the sciences. Great class.","This course is very interesting and you learn a lot in the class, but the work is difficult and understanding the information requires a lot of outside work.","This was the best class I've ever taken in my life.. Professor Tierney is amazing, and I genuinely feel like a better writer now.  Great choice for expos.","This course is exorbitant in terms of its workload - from the readings, to the response papers, to the essays, and to the peer review activities. While giving and getting feedback is worthwhile, the whole process of writing letters to the instructor and to your peers is an absolute waste of time and is in certain cases harder than writing the paper itself. Do not take this course if you are not inclined to spending your time on psychology.\r\n\r\nThe grading is not fair and can in fact be characterized as arbitrary. The reasons that the instructor provides for the grades are often unfounded, and it seems as though the grading is not objective. It also appears that the instructor makes the grade up in her mind before reading the paper and then concocts reasons for assigning that grade."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"3.70","enrollment":"15","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
