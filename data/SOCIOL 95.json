If this class had not been required I would have dropped it as soon as possible.","I would tell future students that this course is extremely cumbersome and not helpful in augmenting research or interest in non-profits.","Much of the hours required for this class depend on your indiivdual project","Don't take this class if you are looking to change the world or if you want an easy class.. take this class only if you are willing to perform meaningless tasks","I fully recommend this course IF you have a non profit in mind for your project and IF you are interested in learning about non profit structure and organization."]},"Spring '08":{"comments":["That it is extremely useful and informative and well done. I would recommend maybe not doing it as part of New Sector, but just with an organization you are really interested in.

I learned a lot and the course got me started on thinking of nonprofit organizations in a new light."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["I don't know if Josh will still be teaching this class in the future, but you should hope that he is. He understands students, and the demands placed on them, and has been one of the most accommodating professors I've had here. He also understands what is necessary and helpful to a course he inherited, and what is chaff. In the future, I have full faith he can continue to refine it into the smooth workshop it ought to be. If you do take this class though, have an organization in mind that you have experience with, as 2 kids dropped this semester when their organizations became unresponsive and they couldn't finish their projects.","This course is AMAZING!  If you have a nonprofit project you want to undertake, this is the perfect format.  Josh gave us the freedom to really pursue our interests and was very supportive about meeting us.  I felt like our class grew closer, and we had a blast!
