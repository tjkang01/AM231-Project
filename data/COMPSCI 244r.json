PLEASE, PLEASE spare yourself the headache and take any other course in the CS department. What you learn from this course lacks substance, and instead of actually working on something you'll just be doing a lot of pointless presentations that make you suicidal. There is literally no teaching that goes on: the instructor is amazingly atrocious, and TFs are virtually nonexistent. You'll be stressing about the most stupid things (\"does the instructor like the stupid website that I build?\") instead of actually learning. This course isn't a breeze either: you'll be doing a lot of pointless work all around, and your project will turn out to be mediocre since you couldn't get that microcontroller to interface nicely with the Cloud at 4 a.m. (after working on it for 15 hours without help from any of the instructors, of course). I am very disappointed to end my undergraduate career with this disgrace of a course."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["This course is an overview of networking and gives you insight on design decisions of the Internet.","It's a great course that is project-oriented so you will be working on one thing you are interested in for the majority of the semester; choose wisely!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"28.57","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPSCI 244R","course_id":"1263","cat_num":"112631","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPSCI 244r","course_id":"1263","cat_num":"3018","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPSCI 244R","course_id":"1263","cat_num":"112631","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
