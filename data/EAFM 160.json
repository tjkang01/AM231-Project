Since there is a greater focus on presentation compared to the research component, you might consider taking the class if you are interested in web design or interactive presentations. If you just want a survey of what kind of DH tools are out there, I would recommend to audit the class instead, since the assignments can be quite heavy.","It's a fun class to take, especially if you'd like to learn about what digital humanities is and pick up a variety of digital tools that may be useful to you down the line. For example, some things we learned about were Photoshop, data mining, Unity, and Webflow (a site where you can make your own websites without coding at all). The class isn't highly structured, which may be a downside to a few. For me, however, it was a nice break from my other classes.","If you are interested in understanding how humanities research and knowledge representation is being shaped by changes in technology then clearly this is a course that is well suited for you. Personally I found that the course was at its best in introducing its students to the new ways in which knowledge can be presented. The evaluation was the production of a website; which for me was entirely novel, but a skill which I am now glad to have."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.90","workload":"7.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
