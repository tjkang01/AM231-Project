Not many classes have that.","This class is quite as fun as you think a class on witchcraft will be, but the material is nevertheless very interesting. Ricky is very enthusiastic and does a good job moderating group discussions.","Expos sucks, but Ricky makes this class the best option!","Do not take if you are trying to get an A","This is a good expos class. Not only is it interesting and entertaining, but Ricky is a great teacher. He focuses on writing above all else, and he provides extensive feedback on all assignments. There isn't a lot of reading, and you might be exposed to a field of study that you find interesting. You'll watch and read Harry Potter, and you can choose any example of witchcraft for your research paper. List this as one of your top preferences for expos.","This is a great expos class! I absolutely hate any writing, in general, but really enjoyed this class! This discussion was awesome and student led and the fact that you get to write a paper on Harry Potter is a bonus. I definitely recommend this expos class!","This course deals more specifically with the anthropological study of witches and their place in society, i.e. this won't be a fun fiction class with Harry Potter and Narnia.","You have to take it.","It is probably one of the best ways in which one can fulfill their expository writing requirement.","The readings and topics discussed in class were interesting and made writing the papers bearable."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"5.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.60","enrollment":"15","response rate":"86.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
