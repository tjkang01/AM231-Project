His lectures combined with a relatively easy work load makes this class a gem.","One of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. The atmosphere in the seminar style classroom is unreal. I felt enlightened every time I walk out of the class. Needless to say, I didn't miss I single class for how excited I was about them.","Perhaps is not the most organized course I have taken but it is one of the most stimulating.","Professor Sevcenko is absolutely brilliant and creates interesting connections. You will also learn a ton about Brazil's literary and cultural history. He literally knows everything about everything.","This class was fascinating. Professor Sevcenko is such an interesting intellectural to learn from. I definitely recommend this class."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Prof. Sevcenko does it again and again. This is the third course I have taken with Prof. Sevcenko, and together his courses are among the most thrilling experiences at Harvard. If you are studying Portuguese, a seminar with him is a must and a worthy goal. Be prepared to discuss entirely in Portuguese.","Nicolau is amazing! He is so passionate and helps you to think about things in a way that you never would have before the course. He is also there to help you on your own learning journey, and as such, this course was one of my favorites. I got to write a paper on a topic I was really passionate about, and I learned a great deal about Brazil and popular culture through the lens of literature, poetry and art.","It's really interesting. Sevcenko makes you have an epiphany weekly, but sometimes, it might be difficult to figure out how each lecture relates to the overarching theme."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.44","workload":"1.78","difficulty":"2.44","recommendation":"4.67","enrollment":"10","response rate":"90.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PORTUG 180","course_id":"4456","cat_num":"29198","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PORTUG 180","course_id":"4456","cat_num":"29198","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PORTUG 180","course_id":"4456","cat_num":"29198","1s":"3","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
