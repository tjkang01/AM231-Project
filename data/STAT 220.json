There is a lot of independent learning going on so definitely read BDA and perhaps even some of the supplementary articles that Prof Liu suggests.","Watch out who is teaching it. \r\nCertainly shop it and see for yourself.","Stat 220 covers some very cool material. Anyone interested in Bayesian statistics realizes that this course covers a lot of this material. However, the lectures were very disorganized which made things difficult. The description of the course said that simulation would be emphasized. However, much of lectures and too much of the homework was working things out analytically. I wish it had been even more emphasis on simulation.\r\n\r\nThe class was ultimately saved by the book, which is a very well written statistics book, and the TF who was very helpful in teaching the material and helping with the homework.\r\n\r\nI was also very upset that a midterm was added. It was not on the original syllabus and was not officially added  until after shopping period ended.","This is a class with difficult material and confusing lectures, so I learned much of the material either through section or independently by reading the textbook and wikipedia.

The course is a fairly significant time commitment, but you learn a ton from doing the psets.  The TFs this semester (the Alexs) were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about the subject, and Professor Gelman is really perhaps the best resource available for all things Bayesian.  Don't expect to learn the material just by going to lecture though.  Lectures mainly consist of stories that can enhance your understanding if you've already read through the chapters but can sometimes detract from it if you haven't.  Overall it's a wonderful class that I would certainly recommend to any students with a substantial stats background looking for a good data analysis course!","I hope Andrew Gelman is teaching it!","My understanding is that this class is very different when Gelman is not teaching it. But I highly recommend taking anything he is teaching if he's ever back at Harvard. It was very useful getting to hear him talk about statistics and seeing how he thinks about things. It was one of my favorite classes I've taken.","This class is very difficult. Gelman taught the entire book. Don't expect any solutions.","The course is extremely informative, but be aware that the weekly homework assignments are exceptionally time consuming.","You'll learn Bayesian methods that are totally mind-opening and not taught elsewhere.  You'll be able to code in R like a pro by the end of the course.  It takes a ton of effort, but the bang is definitely worth the buck--just be sure to clear your schedule.","This course is insanely difficult, but if you have the time to devote to working through each pset it will be wort the effort.","This course (taught by Andrew Gelman) was one of my most amazing Harvard experiences. Our class got the chance to read from the bible of Bayesian data analysis and learn from the author himself. The textbook is incredibly good, and Gelman is a wonderfully entertaining lecturer.","This class--at least when taught by Gelman--is fantastic.  Easily the best class I've had at Harvard so far.  You'll learn a hell of a lot about Bayesian inference and you'll get real practical skills in building models and--most importantly!--checking them.","You should beg someone in power to beg Andrew Gelman to come back and teach this class again.","Each 90-minute lecture was approx. 35 minutes of learning and 55 minutes of rambling and discussing.  You have to learn everything on your own or with the help of the TFs.  Lecture often degenerated into useless discussions about tangential topics between the professor and a handful of overeager students sitting in the front row.  The course material is useful to statisticians but if the course is run like it was this semester, it isn't worth it at all.","20+hrs on psets every week","You will add a new set of Bayesian tools to your statistical analysis toolbox.

If you come to lecture knowing what's going on, Jun can give some cool insights and often discusses philosophical implications or subtle points related to the topics. Having said that, course organization is a little shaky, and you won't learn much if you just show up to lecture without spending some time with the book or other outside sources.","If you know Bayesian statistics already and want to dig deeply into the underlying rational, this course is the one to go. Otherwise, pause a little bit, finish the book before taking this course.","Look: the course topics are fascinating. You need it to be a data scientist, and Bayesian analysis is now the standard rather than the fringe.\n\nBut be warned: this class is AWFUL. When one student asked for a schedule of future topics, the lecturer explicitly said the he would be changing things around until the last minute, so could not provide any outline of topics to be covered. That's how disorganized the class was. Lectures were incoherent (the first half the time was spent discussing utterly unrelated topics while he tried to figure out what he was supposed to lecture about) and unrelated to the problem sets. It was difficult, not because the material is inherently difficult, but because we would be asked to solve problems and discuss topics that we would learn 6 weeks later. Later problem sets were in turn trivial because they used topics we had learned 8 weeks ago.\n\nOh, and the general G1 consensus is that the textbook, BDA, sucks. It's poorly written, fraught with typos, and about as disorganized as the course. If you actually want to learn some Bayesian analysis, pick up Hogg.\n\nThe only (minor) saving grace of the course with Giri, who made grading much less stressful than it could have been and whose sections\/notes were quite good (though often completely illegible).","This class is A LOT of work, including a lot of self-learning. Definitely recommend taking the undergraduate version (120) beforehand if you have no knowledge of Bayesian statistics.","This course covers a wide range of material that any serious statistics student should know; it is a good in-depth overview of this material. However, students will find that they will largely have to teach themselves the material; often, they'll have to depend on resources outside of the lectures and textbook, because the textbook can be very difficult to read.","definitely necessary for advanced statics. but be aware of the course load","Be prepared for a lot of stuffs.","Make sure you know a lot of statistics before taking this course as it is not an taught at an introductory level."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Honestly very difficult.

No feedback on the MCMC code, which is really the point, no discussion of how to tell if the algorithms were actually working or even how to use STAN at all, no emphasis on what packages to use in R or how to code it in Python, or how to code in a computationally efficient way.","Subject matter is great, but teaching is all over the place","Stat 220 presents interesting and helpful material, and you will learn a lot from doing the assignments.  However, the lectures are not well-organized and can be difficult to understand if you don't have much background in the subject of Bayesian statistics.  Additionally, the problem sets are very long, but they are useful.","The information in this class is important and you will definitely revisit the material throughout your statistics career. Unfortunately this is the only class that it is offered and there is not introductory class to help you be prepared for the high level of this class.","My comments will serve as priors for future students. This is the only Bayesian course in the department and if you want to learn the subject, you have to take it. But be prepared to get crazy with the last several homework assignments. I recommend you to have some background in Bayesian statistics, MCMC and being confident in R. Lastly, I hope my comments will not be censored.","Material is useful and interesting, but the execution of the course was not great.","Challenging but worth it. The course covers a ton of material that you won't get elsewhere. Jun's lecture style takes a little time to get used to, but the cool part is hearing his perspective about methods and the underlying philosophy of Bayesian statistic. The class does depend a lot on the TF. Shihao was great\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsection was very helpful dealing with some of the more complicated concepts. It's a manageable stat class for an undergrad: you can get by with 110, familiarity with MCMC methods, and being very comfortable working with pdfs and probability integrals. Psets take time but aren't impossible, so start early and ask questions. The textbook is fine, but I'd recommend using office hours and other resources for some of the more difficult concepts (like Dirichlet processes and causal inference)."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["If you read the book (Bayesian Data Analysis) early in the semester or before taking the course, it's a good course and you will learn a lot through the assignments. Otherwise, it's difficult to follow. Great to take in combination with Stat 213, they complement each other very well.","It's a good course for introduction to Bayesian and practice. Please expect some time-consuming programming homework. Overall, Prof. Liu tries to cover both theoretical and application part, and he did quite well.","Take it if you want to become a data scientist","This is generally not an enjoyable course unless you are already very comfortable with Bayesian statistics conceptually and computationally.  If you are not already familiar with Bayesian statistics you will need to spend many hours per week self-teaching yourself from the Gelman textbook and working on problem sets. The problem sets are assigned each week and are often quite long.","I took this because I need to take enough grad stat classes for my degree and wanted something applied. Topics are solid but I learned on my own since the teaching and notes were not good.","The class is an interesting high-level discussion of Bayesian methods. It is important to have some exposure to the material before (e.g. STAT 120) as much is assumed known.","Bayes rule is so important and this class gives you a great understanding of Bayesian stats. The weekly problem sets end up being a fair amount of work.","Avoid at all costs! The lecturer does not care at all for the students and rambles on about random topics vaguely related to the material. There was no feedback on the assignments. This is really a self-study course with occasional testing that is largely unrelated to the work. Whatever you don't figure out by yourself you will not learn in this class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.40","workload":"11.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.50","enrollment":"32","response rate":"65.62","QCourseOverall":{"number":"STAT 220","course_id":"4847","cat_num":"118016","1s":"2","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"5","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"STAT 220","course_id":"4847","cat_num":"6270","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"9","5s":"10"},"QWorkload":{"number":"STAT 220","course_id":"4847","cat_num":"118016","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"7"}},"success":true}
