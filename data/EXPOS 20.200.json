I got forced into this class through a sectioning mistake, so make sure your schedule works before sectioning. Biggest mistake of the year, by far.","Make sure to read up on the course material prior to taking the class and determine whether or not you are interested","It is very work intensive and you should only take this course if you have a massive interest in improvisation in life and art. If that's not your passion, you probably shouldn't take the course.","I feel as if my \"reservations\" in the recommendation have more to do with expos in general than with this particular section. Jim is a good teacher, and very willing to be helpful. The topic is also very interesting, though be forewarned that improv comedy is only one part of the material. Overall, very interesting and a topic that I'm glad I was able to think about in depth.","My writing improved tremendously. The assigned reading and homework assignments were exciting work that included insightful, thought-provoking ideas. The assignments were broad enough to allow you to make of them what you will \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I'll go so far as to posit that any student who had did not enjoy this course did so of their own choosing.","It's not going to exist without Jim. I suppose if it does, it could be a lot better. So if you're a student reading these comments, I would like to say that the class could be really enjoyable if the teacher were different. Improvisation is a broad topic and that is VERY open to interpretation.","Terrible. Just terrible. The preceptor has a very fixed style that he looks for, and often doesn't understand complex concepts. Expect lots of work, and bad grades if you're good at writing."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"2.60","workload":"2.80","difficulty":"3.90","recommendation":"2.20","enrollment":"10","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.200","course_id":"1732","cat_num":"14966","1s":"4","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 20.200","course_id":"1732","cat_num":"14966","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.200","course_id":"1732","cat_num":"14966","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
