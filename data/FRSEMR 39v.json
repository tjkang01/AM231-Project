Professor Svendsen is wonderful, and this seminar was always one of my favorite parts of the week.","The course materials are all really interesting if you like art, nature, philosophy, reading.  A good mix of old\/classical literature and art and more modern sources. We learned a lot about analyzing art and images, which I didn't expect. Christina is awesome and VERY knowledgeable, it's not all that time-consuming, and the readings are just generally interesting.","Spend time with the readings and the other assignments; let the ideas soak in. Also, you'll get more out of the course if you actively compare and connect the works that you're currently reading with the works from previous weeks.","This seminar offers the most interesting and in-depth discussion of literature, film, and art that I've ever been exposed to before.","I would tell students that this course is fundamentally unique to what many freshman can hope to take in a larger course with lectures. It is a way to truly synthesize new and exciting ideas due to the nature of the flexibility of the discussion that takes place and the limited number of students enrolled.","Come into the course with an open mind towards new interpretations of what you think you might already know."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.10","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.20","enrollment":"11","response rate":"72.73","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 39v","course_id":"10832","cat_num":"21129","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 39v","course_id":"10832","cat_num":"21129","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 39v","course_id":"10832","cat_num":"21129","1s":"2","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
