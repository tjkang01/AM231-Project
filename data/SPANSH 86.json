Mart\u00c3\u00adn is an awesome professor, and I loved the course material. Workload is fairly light and is very manageable, but it is slightly heavier in the second half of the semester.","This class was super straightforward and had low time requirements. Classes were kept exciting by a lot of varied readings, different, creative activities, constant group work, and two or three class visits to museums. Super interesting material and not a lot of pressure in terms of work and expectations!","The was one of my favorite classes ever. I learned a lot and Martin made the class exciting, interesting, and fun.","This is a great class. The topic is very interesting, especially if you have a desire to go into medicine or healthcare. It's a good way to strengthen your Spanish skills without studying grammar rules like in a traditional language class. Mart\u00c3\u00adn is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and is always accessible and helpful in terms of giving feedback. Take the class, it may change the way you think about plants and indigenous knowledge!","Great syllabus with a wonderful variety of materials and a dedicated and crazy interesting TF!","I absolutely loved this class. It may have been my favorite Spanish class I have taken as an undergraduate. It was engaging and challenging, but not overly demanding in terms of workload.","Mart\u00c3\u00adn made this course. He is so patient and understanding and really passionate about the subject material. So interesting and gained more knowledge about medicine and care and culture than any premed class and got to practice my spanish. 10\/10 an incredible course","It was a very interesting and fun class. Martin is great and is always eager to help with anything you may need."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"2.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"13","response rate":"84.62","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
