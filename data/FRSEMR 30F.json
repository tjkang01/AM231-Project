A lot of the readings and facts that were presented felt pretty irrelevant. Shed a lot of light on one of the weirdest films I've seen.","It's a great class but there is a lot of lecture involved.","Comprehensive class on not simply Taxi Driver, but also film history and the political\/social zeitgeist of the transition period between the 1960s and the neocon 1980s.","A great course to go along with other extremely work intensive ones. This allows for an enjoyable respite to an otherwise busy schedule.","Unless you want to pursue film studies seriously, this course can be dry and uninteresting. Many of the classes were lectures, which is not what a freshman seminar should be.","This is a great seminar for any freshman interested in film. You learn an incredible amount about the movie taxi driver, as well as film studies and film history in general. The readings may seem dry or unimportant at times but it is a freshman seminar so you do not have to do all of them. This is an easy and fun course that I would recommend.","I would certainly recommend this class to a friend if they were interested in going super in depth on any film.","If you really like film history and film analysis you might really enjoy it, but otherwise I just thought it was okay. Professor Pena is really nice and seems like a great guy, but I didn't find lectures all that interesting and the readings felt irrelevant since they weren't discussed in class. There were no assignments (besides assigned readings) until the last few weeks of class when we had to prepare a presentation of a 20-minute sequence from Taxi Driver. The instructions on this presentation were fairly vague so there was a lot of flexibility on how to do the assignment, which was nice. Overall it was an okay course and not a bad seminar to take."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.10","workload":"1.90","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.20","enrollment":"12","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 30F","course_id":"13038","cat_num":"159724","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"5","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 30F","course_id":"13038","cat_num":"159724","1s":"7","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
