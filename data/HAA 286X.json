A good way to learn about Asian art at a time when Japan and the rest of the world was becoming more modernized.","This course covers really interesting material. The readings can be a bit much, but they are engaging, and you will learn a lot focusing on 2 each week.","Professor McCormick is a gem, she's incredibly sweet and makes the class extremely interesting. Overall, I'd recommend this class! It can be daunting for someone who doesn't have prior experience, but she really guides you along.","be prepared for dense readings but great discussions","This class was truly wonderful. Prof. McCormick is a great teacher who, in addition to clearly being exceptionally knowledgeable and passionate about the material, also has a gift for transferring that passion to her students. She is extremely kind and approachable; make use of her generous office hours. The discussions were always great, and as an undergrad I was very grateful for the presence of the grad students because of the rigor and expertise they brought to class discussions. A great dynamic, great material. The written assignments are light but the readings are not light; get started on them early in the week."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"7.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"11","response rate":"81.82","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 286X","course_id":"12470","cat_num":"156278","1s":"2","2s":"5","3s":"5","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 286X","course_id":"12470","cat_num":"156278","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"3"}},"success":true}
