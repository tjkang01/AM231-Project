Buckholtz is so interesting to learn from.","Buckholtz is the best teacher you will ever have in your academic experience. Regardless of what the topic is, take any class you can with him. Every moment you get to spend in an academic setting with him is a blessing!","Honestly one of the most rewarding classes I've taken here. Professor Buckholtz is the best, and this class really opened up my eyes about not just psychopathy, but academia and its nuances.","TAKE THIS COURSE. Buckholtz is at his finest here, without the stress of grades (as I found in Psy 18) you really get to learn the material in a meaningful and intimate way. Someone please tenure this man.","This will be the best psych class you can take at Harvard. Do what you can to take it.","Josh is an incredible person. Apart from learning a lot, take advantage of having access to him as a person and interact with him outside of class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"16","response rate":"62.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 2485","course_id":"13469","cat_num":"159711","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 2485","course_id":"13469","cat_num":"159711","1s":"3","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
