While this course examines South Asia from key thematics like communalism, law, nationalism, etc., it also moves beyond this approach to engage with theoretical underpinnings of such themes. Therefore, in conversations and texts, it is not Gandhi, Ambedkar, the RSS, etc. that are pivotal figures but Foucault, Weber, Durkheim, Marx, etc. as well.","Do as much of the reading as you possibly can--don't skim. It will be so much more helpful if you do a close reading.","1. read through the syllabus and decide if all the topics interest you\r\n2. Although the course is titled as South Asia, it covers only India and Pakistan","The course will allow you to gain a synoptic overview of the different aspects of South Asia and give you powerful exploratory theoretical lens through which to investigate different social and historical phenomenon.","Take it only if you want be extremely challenged, but in the end it will be worthwhile because you will benefit so much."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"7.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"11","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 2675","course_id":"12869","cat_num":"122136","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 2675","course_id":"12869","cat_num":"122136","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
