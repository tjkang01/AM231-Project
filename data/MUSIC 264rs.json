If you already have a lot of Max\/MSP experience, take advantage of the opportunity to help your classmates out and in so doing further your own fundamental understanding (teaching is the best way of reviewing?).  Also, find other students who are in the class who have max\/msp experience and try working through higher level concepts with them.","This is a good class for learning Max\/MSP, especially more advanced approaches.
