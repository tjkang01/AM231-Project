Because of the wonderfully varied syllabus, the class is an excellent springboard for further research into a number of authors and genres.","This course provides an excellent overview of Egypt as it appears in Greek literature of various time periods, beginning in the Classical period and continuing through late Roman times. If you wish to learn more about cross-cultural interactions, this class may be quite enjoyable.","You will learn a ton in this class! Yvona is really great at facilitating stimulating discussions among the students!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CLAS-STDY 149","course_id":"11194","cat_num":"52181","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CLAS-STDY 149","course_id":"11194","cat_num":"52181","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CLAS-STDY 149","course_id":"11194","cat_num":"52181","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
