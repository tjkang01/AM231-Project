The skit involves parroting back lines that are still too complicated for you to understand yet because you haven't had enough instructional time actually learning the language! But you don't have that time learning he language under your belt because you will have been wasting so much class time memorizing the skit lines. Its a very avoidable catch-22 created by the bizarre Theater Night policy of the ALP, not by the actual Twi instructor, who is wonderful.","Great class! Prince is great and it's a tight-knit community.","Do not take this class unless you are ready to learn a lot independently. Price is a great guy, but his teaching style is all over the place.
