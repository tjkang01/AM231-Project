More importantly, though, the class is well taught and has emphasis on both translation and textual significance, and even looks somewhat at influences from other authors.","The tragedies are fascinating and Professor Tarrant is pretty much a god (but not the impotent\/absent gods of Seneca's plays!). If your Latin isn't stellar, like mine wasn't, expect to ask a lot of painstaking translation questions (they'll invariably be graciously answered) and to make vocabulary lists for yourself and memorize them. A great introduction to literature classes in languages other than English with a real world expert, interesting lectures and fun discussions. Take this!","This class is so helpful in reading Seneca and ancient dramas in general. Prof. Tarrant not only teaches you how to read Seneca, but also gives you the skills to read literature. If you know Latin, please work with Prof. Tarrant. He is THE best!","Tarrant is fantastic! Take this course if you like reading plays! Be ready to participate in class","This class is a really great introduction to Seneca, an author that I myself never studied at all. It's a great discussion of plays as a literary piece.","This class was both challenging and redeeming. Professor Tarrant does a great job in leading the class. The small amount of students makes both the professor and personal learning very easy. The works were read were very interesting, a highlight of Roman Tragedy in the 1st century A.D. Overall, it was a very enjoyable class and I would recommend it to any students pursuing a Classics Concentration or a Latin Citation."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"3.30","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
