Just realize that the work load is considerably more demanding than most courses in this department. There are weekly response papers (with the possibility of skipping only once). This in addition to the other writing assignments and the three presentations throughout the term plus the heavy literary and critical reading load can be overwhelming at times (especially the weeks you have to present). That said, you do get a lot out of this course and it's definitely worth the hard work required.","This is a very challenging course but it is really, really helpful if you don't know much about French lit. I feel more than just learning about hysteria, what I am taking out of this class is experience with research, how to dissect texts at the graduate level, and just a general feeling of what grad school level literature feels like. I strongly recommend it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"12.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRENCH 259","course_id":"4408","cat_num":"3349","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRENCH 259","course_id":"4408","cat_num":"3349","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRENCH 259","course_id":"4408","cat_num":"3349","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"3"}},"success":true}
