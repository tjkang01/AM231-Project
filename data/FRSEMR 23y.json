If you enjoy physics and plan on concentrating in a physics related area this class will be very valuable for future classes.","This class is perfect for students interested in learning about the fundamental concepts in physics, regardless of whether or not they plan to concentrate in physics.  The emphasis is on understanding concepts and why they are important and exciting rather than on the math.  Professor Doyle will answer any questions you might have regarding physics; no question will be left unanswered.  This class is the perfect way to get excited about physics without being bogged down by the math and daily grind of problem sets.  Fun demos and projects such as making a vortex shooter reminded me of why I like physics in the first place."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"1.70","difficulty":"2.00","recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 23y","course_id":"10796","cat_num":"95524","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 23y","course_id":"10796","cat_num":"95524","1s":"3","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 23y","course_id":"10796","cat_num":"95524","1s":"5","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
