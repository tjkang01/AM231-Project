The content is broad too, and I felt a lot was covered in just one semester and left with more knowledge, and I am really glad I took this class for that reason.","This class is SO interesting and important! Definitely worth taking!","Especially if you haven't thought about women's issues or workplace gender dynamics much, this is a fantastic course (and even if you have, it still is). Readings are short enough to keep your attention and are very interesting and relevant; class discussion moved at a good pace and I was rarely bored. There are only three writing assignments, the first two of which combine to form the first half of the third, which is a final paper; at least in our iteration of the course, the final paper was basically an opportunity to analyze qualitative research and write it up, similarly to what you would do for a thesis, and it was a FANTASTIC way to learn more about sociological method and to think really critically about the themes covered in the courses. One of my favorite classes at Harvard so far!!!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"4.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOCIOL 112","course_id":"13828","cat_num":"141657","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOCIOL 112","course_id":"13828","cat_num":"141657","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
