I expected it to be a low-key, fun class. Instead, it involved spending hours every week preparing boring texts and then analyzing them in class in ways that did not bring out any additional meaning. Stern was the most disorganized professor I have ever experienced, and unless you want to bang your head against a wall out of frustration for an entire semester, I don't recommend taking him in general or this class in particular. The midrash that we discussed were not especially intriguing and also were mostly analyzed from a literary perspective, rather than interrogating them thematically, which would have been much more interesting.","This class provides a broad exposure to different genres of midrash."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"2.80","workload":"3.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.50","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HEBREW 243","course_id":"13293","cat_num":"160490","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HEBREW 243","course_id":"13293","cat_num":"160490","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
