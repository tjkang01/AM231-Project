Taking a course with Professor Scanlon will do that to you. On the one hand I feel slightly deflated in that I didn't leave the course with an enormous amount of open questions because I thought we gave good answers to many of them. On the other hand the course answered questions which plague a lot of us in deep ways, so it's also a good feeling.","It's incredibly interesting but dense material. It's worth the investment!","The class is great! Professor Scanlon (who unfortunately retired and will not teach this course by the time you consider taking this) did an amazing job leading the seminars, invoking great discussions about the topic and really digging deep into the texts. It can at times be laborious; the readings aren't easy, and some of them are quite difficult, and as such I would not recommend this being your first philosophy class. But if you are in any way, shape, or form, interested in moral responsibility and blame, this would be a great class to check out.","This is seminar on a very interesting topic with one of the leading contributors in the field. The ideas have been incredibly relevant both to my thinking about everyday life and issues in related fields like psychology and politics\/law.","Unless you come in with strong background knowledge, it's very difficult to rewardingly engage with the course. Either be prepared to spend huge tracts of time reading and processing the material, or choose something with a more interactive and approachable format.","Unfortunately, Prof. Scanlon is leaving, but it was an incredibly rewarding class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"4.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"20","response rate":"70.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHIL 178S","course_id":"13835","cat_num":"159753","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHIL 178S","course_id":"13835","cat_num":"159753","1s":"1","2s":"12","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
