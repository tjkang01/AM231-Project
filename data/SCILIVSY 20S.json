Jason Mitchell is everything you need and want in this world. Everything is discussion based and really interesting. Jason answers all of your questions. The atmosphere of the class is really about hands on learning and it ends up generating a lot of enthusiasm. There are no tests! Only writing sets which were fairly easy as long as you paid attention, which won't be a problem because you'll want to pay attention. I LOVE THIS! YOU SHOULD TAKE IT!","I loved this course so much and I would really recommend it. It makes it really special that it is a lottery style class because it is a class full of really interesting and interested students.","If you want a background in psychology, but prefer a smaller classroom and more freedom with how lectures are carried out, I would highly recommend this course! And Prof Mitchell is great!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"4.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"13","response rate":"84.62","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SCILIVSY 20S","course_id":"13365","cat_num":"160737","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"SCILIVSY 20S","course_id":"13365","cat_num":"160737","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
