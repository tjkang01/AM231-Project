(especially to WGS concentrators looking for a hist of sci class, or hist of sci concentrators interested in delving into some feminist writing)"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["The course will really shock you in terms of how society today continues some of the same perceptions of women's bodies as in the past. It has really opened my eyes to realize how systemic views can frame women's bodies in a manner that is oppressing or even inhumane. The course work is sometimes rather large in readings but doable (as long as you don't leave them for the night before). The class is rather small and allows for a lot of discussion. Professor Jou is also an excellent facilitator of discussion and poses questions concerning the arguments of the readings, so be sure to do them!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"5","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HISTSCI 250","course_id":"2690","cat_num":"72868","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HISTSCI 250","course_id":"2690","cat_num":"72868","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HISTSCI 250","course_id":"2690","cat_num":"72868","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
