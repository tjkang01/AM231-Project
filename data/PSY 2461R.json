The only problem is the final paper."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This was my favorite lab experience by far. Definitely take this course if you're interested in psychology research!!","If you are interested in research at all, you should definitely work in this lab and take this course for credit. I didn't think I wanted to do research, and I have completely changed my mind. What a wonderful class. Take it.","It is a cool experience.","It's a great class to learn about methods in Psych and Dr. Nock is amazing.","I mean it's mostly just free labor that you're providing for the lab. But as far as that goes, this is probably a good one. Nock is fantastic, and the work they do is interesting. I did transcribing. Transcribing is deeply boring and exhausting."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["A great and noble lab.","Dr. Nock is the best!"]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["Dr. Nock is fantastic, but make sure to get on a good project.","The lab is doing tremendous work, and it has been a treat to spend time with those passionate about studying suicide and self-injury in new and creative ways."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Make sure you identify the project and your potential paper idea early on so that you can start planning accordingly throughout the semester.","Dr. Nock is incredibly personable, down-to-earth, and unintimidating despite the fact that he's such a big deal in the field. I really enjoyed working in the Nock lab, and recommend it with enthusiasm for anyone seeking to get lab experience--seriously, he's the best."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This course will give you great exposure on cutting-edge research being conducted on suicide and self-injury. In the process, you'll learn skills to develop into a scientific researcher (i.e. data collection, scientific writing, critical assessment of research study methods, etc.). Moreover, the lab is very supportive and PD opportunities are very helpful."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["This is such a great class. I definitely recommend it to everyone who is interested in the problem of suicidal behavior. Professor Nock is amazing and he surrounds himself in his lab with absolutely outstanding postdocs and Phd students. This course really gives you an opportunity to taste the life of a PhD student while being an undergraduate. Also, at the end of the day, you'll get out of this course as much as you are willing to commit to it - the workload is very flexible."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"8.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 2461R","course_id":"4330","cat_num":"119124","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 2461r","course_id":"4330","cat_num":"8042","1s":"2","2s":"4","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 2461R","course_id":"4330","cat_num":"119124","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
