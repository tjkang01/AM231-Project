What's not to enjoy? Make sure to work piecemeal on it. I usually like to do a ton of planning and then write my papers all at once, but that is not a strategy that works for the thesis. Just write a few pages a day, get a draft done as soon as possible, and it won't be too stressful.","Make sure you and your adviser are on the same page from the start about the way you work, how they can best support you, etc. Also, don't put off the writing!! Seriously, it's so easy to keep putting off the writing because you still don't know exactly what you want to say, but it is way better to have something down on paper than nothing at all. It also allows your adviser to be more helpful, because they can comment on actual written material (another tip: don't ever be embarrassed about your writing with your adviser. Ask them to read everything and anything. They might judge you a little, but they believe in your project and in you, so at the end of the day, they'll help you get better).","This was my best academic experience at Harvard. Keep to the deadlines, find a mentor who you can work well with, and have a blast!","It was an honor to work with Mihaela. I've never had a closer relationship to an academic mentor of mine than I did with her. Any future students of hers will be very lucky.","The tutorial is a wonderful opportunity to follow even the most obscure tangents you might wish to."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.77","workload":"4.31","difficulty":"4.15","recommendation":"4.92","enrollment":"14","response rate":"92.86","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LITER 99b","course_id":"593","cat_num":"1290","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LITER 99b","course_id":"593","cat_num":"1290","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LITER 99b","course_id":"593","cat_num":"1290","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
