The material in this class is very interesting and actually matters in your life, even if you do not pursue a related field in this topic, which leads to interesting discussions. Liz is a great teacher and helps you a lot in your essays. Given, it is still an expos course, meaning the grading is skewered, but this is probably the best expos course Harvard has to offer.","Liz is a great preceptor, and the texts are interesting and pretty easy to get through. HOWEVER, don't underestimate the drawbacks of having a course advertised as being all about The Wire: a lot of people in the class are looking for an easy section and as a result means the in-class experience suffers quite a bit.","Be prepared to write a good amount and review your work more than you probably have in the past.","Fun class that will always have you interested","Although this was a wonderful Expos section, do not be fooled. It is still an Expos class. The materials are fascinating and extremely interesting, but the lack of more formal sources is not a sign that it will be easier. This class will still demand a lot of you.","very interesting class","Liz is awesome, and you really learn about the crises many cities across the world face. Probably one of the best Expos classes"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.14","difficulty":"3.07","recommendation":"4.21","enrollment":"15","response rate":"93.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.034","course_id":"1611","cat_num":"15878","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"9","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 20.034","course_id":"1611","cat_num":"15878","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"12","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.034","course_id":"1611","cat_num":"15878","1s":"1","2s":"10","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
