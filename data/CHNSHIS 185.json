It's collaborative so teamwork is essential.  Also you learn how to use many tools that aid the teamwork process as well as grow your pedagogy and presentation skills.","Great class to both learn about Chinese history and education","Cool concept, the structure needed work though.","It's a great course in that there's space for you to try out new ideas.","A chance to involve in some great educational endeavor and the skill sets developed: curriculum development, video editing, animation, are all practical and good production and fun working experience in which concern about grades do not constrain your creativity.","This class is great - the professors are awesome and the work load is manageable. Definitely recommend it!","Be prepared to work hard but to experience a course unlike any you've taken. If you are interested in Chinese history, instructional design, or the 'revolution' in higher education, this is a good course for you."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.08","workload":"3.08","difficulty":"3.33","recommendation":"3.92","enrollment":"19","response rate":"68.42","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHNSHIS 185","course_id":"781","cat_num":"41785","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHNSHIS 185","course_id":"781","cat_num":"41785","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"6","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHNSHIS 185","course_id":"781","cat_num":"41785","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"6","4s":"2","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
