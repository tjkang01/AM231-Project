Manja guides the class through an exploration of student power, historical movements, perceptions of student activism, and often uses an international lens which was beneficial in understanding the larger world of student organizing and activism. The workload is very manageable, and Manja is truly a hidden gem of the sociology department. The self-guided research project component is also a really great way to explore something you may be interested in, even if it is only tangentially related to activism. Any class that Manja is teaching is a must-take, and this one is no exception, regardless of your level of interest or experience in activism.","A course on student activism could not be taught by a more capable professor. Manja's academic background is incredible, and she consistently bring fresh perspectives to the theories that we review."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"10","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
