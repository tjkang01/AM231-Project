It is a privilege to be able to discuss these ideas with Professor Kremer.","Professor Kremer is so well-versed in the subject, and development is such an important issue. If you're new to the subject, this is a great primer. If you've done a bit of reading before, the class may tread old ground","My boy Mike Kremer is really cool, great guy overall---Really take this seminar","Be prepared for lively and educated discussion that connects broad economic philosophy from the past to current, data-driven economic research.","Great course to take if interested in developmental economics. Professor Kremer is great at leading meaningful discussions and I definitely walked away knowing a lot more than I did before."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"5.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"12","response rate":"91.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 41J","course_id":"12382","cat_num":"156421","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 41J","course_id":"12382","cat_num":"156421","1s":"2","2s":"6","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
