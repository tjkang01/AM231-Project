The final 20-page essay may creep up on you, but the professors are there for office hours, and they are very helpful. Hankins and Nelson are extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter and I learned so much from the course.","James Hankins and Eric Nelson are two of the most effective professors I have had at Harvard. Anyone with a passing interest in political theory or intellectual history should take at least one course with each.","It's a great chance to read everyone you've ever wanted to read, and the professors are brilliant, but it is a lot of work if you want to do all the reading."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This class was an incredible opportunity to interact with world-class professors in a small group environment. The material was excellent and made for meaningful and interesting discussion. I expected this to be one of the highlights of my time at Harvard, and it did not disappoint!","Great class. It's awesome getting take a seminar with two professors who know the material so well and who have translated many of the books. It's also really structured well so the readings all build off each other, and it's not too much work on a weekly basis. Definitely worth taking.","This class improved my thinking about ideas in intellectual history and political philosophy more than any other class I have taken.  It is a great opportunity to think about the most significant works of republican political philosophy from Aristotle to Tocqueville.  Prof. Hankins and Prof. Mansfield had lots of insightful things to say in seminar, and the other students were great as well."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.67","difficulty":"2.83","recommendation":"4.83","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 73a","course_id":"2331","cat_num":"2494","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 73a","course_id":"2331","cat_num":"2494","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 73a","course_id":"2331","cat_num":"2494","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
