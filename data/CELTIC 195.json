S\u00c3\u00acm is fantastic!","S\u00c3\u00acm is wonderful and will get you interested in the subject. The language can be difficult, but S\u00c3\u00acm knows what he's talking about and is very good at helping you through everything you do. He really trusts his students to get their work done when they can and this creates a very mature class environment. Discussion is free and interesting and the poetry is beautiful."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"2.50","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CELTIC 195","course_id":"449","cat_num":"64236","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CELTIC 195","course_id":"449","cat_num":"64236","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CELTIC 195","course_id":"449","cat_num":"64236","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
