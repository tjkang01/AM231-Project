It's definitely worth it in the end!","Senior thesis tutorial is such a critical part of the thesis-writing process. I really learned a lot from being able to share drafts with others & read other people's drafts & share feedback. It also was incredibly helpful to develop a relationship with our tutorial leader, a PhD candidate, and to have that sort of personalized feedback and support throughout the thesis-writing process. It's a humbling experience, and I felt like a grew not only as a writer, but also as a peer \/ advisee \/ learner.","I had two thesis tutorials and this was much better than the other one."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["This is a thesis tutorial and it is exactly what it needs to be to help you get the job done.","This class proved integral to my thesis writing process.
