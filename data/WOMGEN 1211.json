Get ready to have your mind blown.","This class has excellent potential for intellectual and personal enrichment. But only take it if you are willing to give yourself to the class. It's intimate and challenging, but worth it if you are willing to open yourself up.","This class did have a lot of work(mostly readings), but I think this class is extremely useful. I really enjoyed the set-up of the class, and think Professor Meadow is a great teacher. She really helped me think about topics I was passionate about and carve a unique final project that encompassed many things I had questions about. The most transformative class I have taken at Harvard, and would highly recommend!","Every queer and\/or trans student at Harvard should take this course. It's transformative.","This course was my favorite class I have taken at Harvard so far. The readings and discussions were incredibly interesting and I grew very close to the class. If you are at all interested in queer issues, and are interested in looking at these issues from an intersectional approach, you will love this class.","This course will challenge you and encourage you to mine for stories from the depths of your being. This is the most unique course I've ever taken, and the projects that have come from it are inspiring.","This is an incredibly unique course if you have the opportunity to take it. I've never experienced anything like it before at Harvard. It is personally challenging and is a chance to get to know some of your peers and a faculty member very well. You should be passionate about the subjects that are covered in this class in order to get something out of it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"4.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"13","response rate":"69.23","QCourseOverall":{"number":"WOMGEN 1211","course_id":"12662","cat_num":"63756","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"WOMGEN 1211","course_id":"12662","cat_num":"63756","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
