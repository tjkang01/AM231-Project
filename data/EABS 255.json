James Robson is a very knowledgeable and fun professor."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["This class explores the latest methodological and theoretical material on space\/place and pilgrimage\/travel, and how this relates to religious studies in East Asian (particularly Buddhism)."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Great class for those for seek both intro- and in-depth knowledge about Buddhism in China.","A good amount of Buddhist history is a definite. A strong interest in the material is a must. Chinese, Japanese or Sanskrit are hugely beneficial and finally a lot of time. This course is very demanding in terms of the workload.Professor Robson is one of the best educators and nurturers of knowledge that I have experienced at Harvard. This course is a must to engage with a Professor of this caliber. The three hour section is enlightening and I often left with a headache because the conversation was intellectual and driven towards a central argument. This course differs vastly from the undergraduate realm and for that reason and I highly recommend it. However, it is time consuming and only vague interest in the material is not sufficient. Take this course if you really want to see how Buddhist studies is conducted in the scholarly realm and in so doing deepen your understanding of the both the academic and doctrinal field.","It is a great class if you have a strong interest in Buddhist doctrine, but the readings and material in general is difficult. If you are preparing for generals or are studying something related to medieval Chinese Buddhism, you will learn a lot about a variety of important subjects.","James Robson is an expert discussion leader and has a strong command of these materials. Any student serious about Buddhist studies or Chinese history must take this class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"9.99","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"42.86","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EABS 255","course_id":"814","cat_num":"24345","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EABS 255","course_id":"814","cat_num":"24345","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EABS 255","course_id":"814","cat_num":"24345","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
