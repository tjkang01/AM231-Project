Its emphasis on open-source methods is also a plus.","I would recommend this course to any science person who wants an introduction to biophysics, a very hot field right now. It is a very different experience from a normal class and people should be comfortable working in teams and thinking creatively.","It will be a unique experience for you.","This class is what you make out of it. Prof. Church is an amazingly brilliant man and the chance to work with him is pretty fantastic. You will learn a lot if you take advantage of the resources and work on the project, and you will learn very little if you do not.","You may feel uncomfortable if you don't have a strong programming background or a strong grasp of genetics.","This is an amazingly cool opportunity, one of a special set of courses hidden away here at Harvard that give one not only information but opportunity that potentially extends beyond the term.  However, you must be absolutely prepared to be very proactive and on top of things, in order to feel like you are really accomplishing something with this course","Only join if you're a confident person who likes to get passionate about new ideas. This is a class for people who want to create something new and exciting."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"3.10","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"BIOPHYS 101","course_id":"327","cat_num":"6896","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"6","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"BIOPHYS 101","course_id":"327","cat_num":"6896","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"BIOPHYS 101","course_id":"327","cat_num":"6896","1s":"2","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
