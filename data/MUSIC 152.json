Probably not if not.","If Trevor Baca is teaching or being a TF for a class, take that class regardless of what it is.  It will be the smartest thing you do.","The course is a wonderful opportunity to immerse yourself in classical music of the last century, and to actually TALK about that music. Rather than being a fast-paced historical survey, representative works are put on the syllabus to be discussed by the students, with the guidance of the teaching staff. Sometimes discussion got side-tracked, but very often the discussion was fascinating and ended up being immensely rewarding.","Seriously, Professor Hasty is incredible, this music is incredible, and the opportunity  to talk about such cool music with such surgical precision with other thoughtful students of music a value that cannot be expressed.","Great course with great music and a superb TF.  You should definitely take this class; I learned more in it than in the vast majority of my other classes and had more fun too."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["one of the best classes I have taken and will take at harvard; take it if you have the opportunity","Professor Hasty is wonderful, and Trevor is an amazing TA. This course will be enlightening in many ways, and is worth your time."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"7","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MUSIC 152","course_id":"3635","cat_num":"4397","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"MUSIC 152","course_id":"3635","cat_num":"4397","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
