It will teach you about communicating to non-stat audiences, teaching, as well as how to model and visualize data in meaningful ways. Professor Gelman is wonderfully eccentric in his ways, and frequently eats a ton of celery in class -- however, this only adds to the enjoyment! I felt like this class was a biweekly meeting of some of the sharpest minds I've ever come across.","Very enjoyable class that will teach you a number of different skills. Very accessible for undergrads.","Andrew Gelman is the man. He is smart and quirky and hilarious, often all at once.","This course tends to be a bit disorganized and there are no clear learning objectives. Andrew is great, but his teaching is all over the place, which means you never quite know exactly what you're gonna learn. Lots of busywork too in this course -- so beware! Easy stat course if you need one, but otherwise, I wouldn't take it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"6.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"21","response rate":"76.19","QCourseOverall":{"number":"STAT 201","course_id":"12656","cat_num":"156489","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"STAT 201","course_id":"12656","cat_num":"156489","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
