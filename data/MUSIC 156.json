Even if you are interested only in understanding Bach's music (and not in trying to write similar music yourself) this course is very useful in that it gives you a deep appreciation of the technical problems Bach faced and overcame."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["Not to be melodramatic or anything, but it will actually change your relationship to Bach forever.

He's an incredible teacher.","Richard Beaudoin is a PERFECT professor. I would recommend any course taught by him, even if the subject were less interesting and the music less beautiful - but the combination of such a professor with the music of Bach is irresistable. Really one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard.","Prof. Beaudoin was awesome, so it will be different in other years.","This is a wonderful course for any music enthusiast, whether you plan to go into musicology, theory, or just enjoy it as an avocation."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MUSIC 156","course_id":"3638","cat_num":"3930","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MUSIC 156","course_id":"3638","cat_num":"3930","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MUSIC 156","course_id":"3638","cat_num":"3930","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
