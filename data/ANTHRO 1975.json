The assignments aren't too bad, and overall it was a pretty good course.  Nevertheless, my advice is don't take this class if you don't have a strong interest or a background in linguistics and anthropology.","This seminar has quite a bit of reading assigned each week.  However, the readings are usually very interesting, albeit sometimes confusing.  Professor Harkness helps to guide discussions so that the purpose of that week's reading in relation to the main questions of the course (what is a social relation, and what is culture?) are revealed.  The writing assignments are manageable: four 4-6pg essays.  No enormous final essay.  Furthermore, Professor Harkness gives a very wide range for some of the essay topics, which makes those very fun to write.","Professor Harkness is fantastic. I really enjoyed taking this class.","This course will teach you critical anthropological concepts from the bottom up, ensuring that you understand each term that you use and concept that you reference.  It will provoke you to think further and make connections between readings and daily life which render the material relevant.  There is a fair amount of work required, but it is worthwhile if you complete it successfully.","This course is essential. You will think about yourself and your society in a different way, and you'll be given a powerful lens with which to view the world."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.44","workload":"2.33","difficulty":"3.11","recommendation":"4.67","enrollment":"9","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 1975","course_id":"179","cat_num":"22928","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 1975","course_id":"179","cat_num":"22928","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 1975","course_id":"179","cat_num":"22928","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
