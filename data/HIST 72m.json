The readings are interesting and well selected to give you a good comparative view of everyday life in Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, the Soviet Union, and East Germany.  Discussions in class were great, and Julia Timpe does a very good job of encouraging and directing discussion.","This course is the best.  You get to find out about people's ordinary lives under totalitarian governments.  It is a fair amount of work, and extremely interesting material, and Julia is a great instructor.","Take it to understand 20th century dictatorships better but also how everyday life history can be a great tool for analyzing historical trends and events.","Professor Timpe is so kind and approachable. I definitely recommend going to talk to her about papers and assignments ahead of time because she's great at clarifying expectations."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.58","workload":"2.75","difficulty":"2.92","recommendation":"4.58","enrollment":"13","response rate":"92.31","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 72m","course_id":"2330","cat_num":"34539","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 72m","course_id":"2330","cat_num":"34539","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"11","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 72m","course_id":"2330","cat_num":"34539","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"7","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
