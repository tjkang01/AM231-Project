Even when she had to take a few weeks off for a medical procedure, she made sure we have very interesting professors to teach each week, and it was awesome to see the other professors' points of view as well! I loved the mix of grad students and undergrads in this course, because as an undergrad, I got to learn from a lot of really intelligent grad students in a very close-knit setting. She had all of us regularly present passages and our interpretations of them, and I ended up learning a lot from the other students as well! This class is great, and I am SO GLAD I took it!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"20.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SLAVIC 156","course_id":"4562","cat_num":"8650","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"SLAVIC 156","course_id":"4562","cat_num":"8650","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
