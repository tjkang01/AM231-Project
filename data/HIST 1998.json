I don't know when this course might next be offered, but if you have any interest in environmental or Japanese history, Brett Walker's an absolute boss when it comes to teaching those subjects. Really can't recommend this highly enough.","The course helps one to be engaged in the curious gap between the nature and human culture. Given the readings and weekly papers, it can be burdensome at times. Nonetheless, it was a tough and joyful ride to learn a new way of viewing the world we live in and learn what\/how to care about it.","This class represents a very innovative approach to history, it boosts your methodological skillset very effectively. This class offers just the right balance of historiographic survey and research practice.","This class was wonderfully educative about Japanese environmental history. Professor Walker facilitated enlightening discussions about the materials and in general. The reading materials themselves were incredibly interesting. Professor Walker is a great, knowledgable professor."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"6.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"7","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1998","course_id":"13076","cat_num":"160238","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1998","course_id":"13076","cat_num":"160238","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
