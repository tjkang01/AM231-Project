It focuses largely on the function of house museums rather than the function of the home in history. There is a lot of reading (frequently over 400 pages a week) that at times can be incredibly dense. Although the paper assignments are enjoyable, discussion in seminar is often disjointed and hard to follow. It may just be that I was not particularly interested in the topic, but this class was hard to get through.","It's a great, reading and writing-intensive seminar. The field trips were a lot of fun, and I wouldn't have gone any of those places outside of the class.","You should only take this course if you are interested in Colonial homes and their interiors.","THe class is a good introduction to the discipline of material culture and allows you to look at history from a unique angle. If you love museums then you'll love this class. If you think they are boring this class probably won't be your thing.","If you need a colonial course for H&L America this one is good but be aware the subject matter isn't everyone's cup of tea and there are a lot of field trips."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.71","workload":"2.57","difficulty":"3.29","recommendation":"3.29","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90ag","course_id":"2523","cat_num":"15956","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"5","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90ag","course_id":"2523","cat_num":"15956","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90ag","course_id":"2523","cat_num":"15956","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
