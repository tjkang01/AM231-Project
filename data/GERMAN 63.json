You hardly realize the 1.5 hours pass by as you discuss incredibly interesting and important issues. Your ability to speak and understand German improves a ton.","Dania was incredible! This class was always full of lively discussions and we learned a lot--not just German but also about the German history, the complicated cultural aspects, and above all, home, exile and emigration."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"6.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"10","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GERMAN 63","course_id":"13772","cat_num":"160494","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"GERMAN 63","course_id":"13772","cat_num":"160494","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
