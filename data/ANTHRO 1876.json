I learned something new and fascinating at every meeting.  Herzfeld provides useful feedback on all assignments and is accessible outside of class.","Professor Herzfeld is incredibly knowledgeable! This class felt a bit more like story time than a formal lecture and it was incredible! A great course for someone looking to learn about Greek culture and be entertained by a wonderful teacher. Be aware, even though Prof. Herzfeld is relaxed he does expect a lot from his students. You need to show up to every lecture and be ready to participate. This class is really a gem."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 1876","course_id":"11456","cat_num":"80078","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 1876","course_id":"11456","cat_num":"80078","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 1876","course_id":"11456","cat_num":"80078","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
