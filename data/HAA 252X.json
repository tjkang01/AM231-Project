This course not only changed the way I think about the Renaissance, it exemplified how the ways we think about intellect and creativity now have been inherited and adapted from Renaissance (and even earlier) theories. I enjoyed this course so much because I learned more than I could have ever expected from it-- this is the kind of course you talk about with your friends every day as you do the readings and think about the material. You may not expect an Art History course focusing on the Italian Renaissance to change your day-to-day life, but this course will. Professor Maratsos is incredible at drawing out salient points from the reading and discussions and will push you to develop your ideas beyond what you thought was possible. This is a hard class, but if you take it you will be truly proud of your academic work, maybe for the first time in a long time.","This was a great topic to tackle - very specific, rich, and often misunderstood. I really enjoyed the readings, though some were very dense and difficult to understand. Professor Maratsos did an amazing job facilitating our class discussion and explaining parts we did not fully understand in class.","If you study or are interested in Renaissance art, this course should be considered mandatory. The professor's approach to teaching sacred images in the Renaissance is incredibly insightful and important."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"6.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 252X","course_id":"13587","cat_num":"160562","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 252X","course_id":"13587","cat_num":"160562","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
