But at the same time, be ready to learn from those struggles and be in conversation with your colleagues over them.","The texts are fascinating and the professor makes the work accessible and fun...take this class.","This class is very rewarding in some ways, but frustrating in others. I felt like I learned a lot in the course and was forced to stretch myself in order to grasp the concepts we discussed. The discussions can be lively and interesting, and unpacking the theory can be an exciting task. However, sometimes the class feels overwhelming and the conversations often become esoteric and ungrounded. I would recommend going to Professor Bernstein's office hours if you have questions or feel frustrated with the class.","Take this course if you'd like a feel of what the brink of a field looks like.","The readings were incredibly stimulating and will stay with me for the rest of my life; it's not to be taken lightly.","This is a really really fascinating course and has changed my thinking as well as my academic interests. Definitely take it if you get the chance!","Take this class if you want to read cutting edge queer theory and learn about current debates among scholars in that field."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.33","workload":"3.17","difficulty":"3.83","recommendation":"4.17","enrollment":"15","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"WOMGEN 1433","course_id":"4931","cat_num":"42391","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"6","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"WOMGEN 1433","course_id":"4931","cat_num":"42391","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"6","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"WOMGEN 1433","course_id":"4931","cat_num":"42391","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"7","4s":"2","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
