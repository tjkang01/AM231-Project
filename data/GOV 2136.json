Great forum for discussing strengths and weaknesses in the democratization literature, as well as for floating your own twists on these ideas and getting a cross-continental, cross-time perspective of the process.","This was the best course I've ever taken - engaging readings, excellent and enthusiastic teaching, interesting and high-level discussions in class. Take it if at all possible.","This class is great!  The content is fascinating and Levitsky and Ziblatt are both really good professors.","It's more reading than I realized, so plan accordingly.","This class was probably the best graduate seminar I've taken at Harvard or elsewhere.","It's worth taking this class just to be in a seminar with Professors Ziblatt and Levitsky. They're great!","This is one of the better seminars I have been in.  Good class discussion, instructors are engaging.  Lots of work, but interesting and helpful."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This has been one of my favorite classes so far. Prof. Levitsky is amazing, the discussions are really lively, and you learn a ton. Just be aware that there is a lot of reading."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["Good luck!","A great survey of the literature on authoritarianism, democracy and democratization.  Highly recommended!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"7.90","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"13","response rate":"53.85","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 2136","course_id":"2269","cat_num":"5702","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 2136","course_id":"2269","cat_num":"5702","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"5","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 2136","course_id":"2269","cat_num":"5702","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"3","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
