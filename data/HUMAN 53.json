Professor Simpson is extremely likable and does a solid job in lecture. The TFs are very engaging as well, and really want you to succeed. The workload is what you make of it; you can definitely not read the texts and get through the class based on summaries and such. The workload is pretty light; just two big papers and then weekly response papers. Overall, if you like reading and discussing literature in the context of which it was written, this is a great course for you.","This class introduces you to a lot of interesting texts that I feel like are essentials to read at some time in your life. However, the ability to make them connect and actually get anything out of this class is on you. It can really get boring because you're just rushing every week to get the reading done.","This class is a great way to survey political revolutions and reforms through a diverse set of authors. It is extremely organized and a gem of a course.","This class offers you a wide variety of impressive sources to read and discuss.  You will develop a useful vocabulary for defining imaginative texts in terms of politics, and will gain a deeper understanding of what the words \"revolutionary,\" \"reformer,\" and \"conservative\" mean.  It can be challenging to develop a strong understanding of the texts from which you only read excerpts, but the workload is very manageable.","Great class. Professor Simpson's lectures are world class. Sometimes it felt like I should be paying out of pocket to attend each lecture--which is a cool feeling.","This class captures some of the most important texts in the western cannon and help you learn to analyze historical works contextually."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"6.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"8","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HUMAN 53","course_id":"13065","cat_num":"160423","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HUMAN 53","course_id":"13065","cat_num":"160423","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
