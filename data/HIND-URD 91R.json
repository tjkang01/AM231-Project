'13":{"comments":["This class is an excellent way to keep up your Urdu fluency. In our year, the class was composed almost entirely of native Urdu speakers, and each of us struggled initially to express our ideas because it was so much easier to just switch into English. Over the course of the semester, we became much more comfortable with expressing more complex arguments in sustained and high-register Urdu. Richard Ji is an incredible instructor and definitely someone everyone should take a course with at least once during their time at Harvard. It's astonishing to know that he isn't a native speaker of the language because he speaks with a lexical and grammatical accuracy that makes most native speakers seem illiterate."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["If you enjoy Urdu literature and want to delve deeply in a particular branch of the literature or a particular author this course is great. Richard Ji was very helpful and understanding. I have taken many classes with him and he is great about tailoring the class to the needs and interests of his students. I really enjoyed learning from him!"]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Richard Delacy is honestly the most amazing professor I have had in all my time at Harvard.
