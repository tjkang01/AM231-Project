It is mostly a discussion course of readings so it will be different for everyone who takes it. The readings include both science and policy.","One of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. Professor McCarthy is definitely my favourite professor here, and it was a fantastic opportunity to engage in learning about a topic that interests me in a small group setting. Every week our discussions were engaging and interesting, and 2.5 hours flew by in no time."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"OEB 255","course_id":"3987","cat_num":"7753","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"OEB 255","course_id":"3987","cat_num":"7753","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"OEB 255","course_id":"3987","cat_num":"7753","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
