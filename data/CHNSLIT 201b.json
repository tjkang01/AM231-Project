It is not a reading class, but provides very relevant ideas on how to approach the texts.","If you want to get a general understanding of Chinese literature since 1100, especially of various drama genres, folk literature and Chinese vernacular novel, take this!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Professor Waiyee's course was informative and enjoyable. For some weeks the readings were quite heavy and time consuming, especially if you want to do them in Chinese. However, the workload is manageable because the required reading response (weekly) can be on any reading, so you can always focus on reading one thing carefully and skimming the rest. If you are willing to put in the time to do all the assigned readings, you will get a better picture of this period of Chinese literature.","The period the course covers is quite expansive, and you might feel lost at certain point. But in the end, it all comes together and you will see a big picture that you did not see at the beginning of the course. It is quite magical."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.62","workload":"2.75","difficulty":"3.25","recommendation":"4.25","enrollment":"9","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHNSLIT 201b","course_id":"800","cat_num":"1760","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHNSLIT 201b","course_id":"800","cat_num":"1760","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHNSLIT 201b","course_id":"800","cat_num":"1760","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
