Prof. Greene loves the subject, and is very knowledgeable about it.  She caters to students' diverse backgrounds in French and reasons for taking the course, adjusting page lengths and even written assignment languages for different students.","The readings are very interesting- they almost present themselves as fairy tales and are very engaging for the most part. The workload is extremely manageable.","This well-structured class provides an approach to the literature of the Middle Ages through some of its most thought-provoking (and downright fun) works. Virginie is a generous and kind instructor who gives excellent presentations and feedback. I would highly recommend it to anyone curious about the Middle Ages, any RLL student looking to fulfill a French requirement, or anyone, frankly, who enjoys great, \"discutable,\" stories.","Go to the professor's office hours (they are very helpful). Take this class only if you have an interest in 12th century french literature."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"7.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRENCH 105","course_id":"12601","cat_num":"156568","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRENCH 105","course_id":"12601","cat_num":"156568","1s":"3","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
