You wont find a better instructor than Professor Greenblatt, she is understanding, she values her students, and she really wants you to learn and enjoy the course, and does an incredible job of tailoring it to the students and providing all the support necessary to really grow and benefit from it. It was a pretty small course, which I loved, because it gave us a chance to really get to know each other, and have fun, intellectual discussions on the material. Professor Greenblatt isnt above letting us direct the conversation or the questions, and it was something I looked forward to every week! I really recommend this course if you have ANY interest in Judaism or Jewish history, its such a great atmosphere, Professor Greenblatt is incredible and so knowledgeable (this is not my first course with her), and the material is within reach for anyone regardless of their background.","Take this class if you enjoy a lot of class discussion. The readings are very useful in gaining an understanding of the subject matter, but also be prepared to go beyond the reading, especially to find an appropriate research topic. Professor Greenblatt is earnest and helpful; she also is clearly very fluent in the topic."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"1.70","difficulty":"2.70","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 60e","course_id":"10910","cat_num":"76199","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 60e","course_id":"10910","cat_num":"76199","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 60e","course_id":"10910","cat_num":"76199","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
