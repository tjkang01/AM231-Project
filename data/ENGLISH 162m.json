Professor Albright is really excellent, the very professor one hopes to encounter at Harvard, both with a seemingly limitless knowledge base and a sense of humor. It was the highlight of my semester.","if you enjoy weird, trippy theatre, then this class if for you! Or if you are interested in modernism in general, also great - the class uses theatre as a jumping board to analyze modernist music and art as well. You will learn so much from Professor Albright.","There is no course like this course. You won't regret taking this course. You learn so much and in so many different ways. I have never really studied theatre or anything like this in the English department, and I couldn't have higher recommendations for this course. The professor was brilliant, the assignments were interesting, and the readings were amazing. I can't really explain to you how much you'll appreciate this course, so you should probably just go ahead and take it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"8","response rate":"62.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 162m","course_id":"10765","cat_num":"15341","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 162m","course_id":"10765","cat_num":"15341","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 162m","course_id":"10765","cat_num":"15341","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
