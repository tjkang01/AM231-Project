Highly recommended to those with interests in Byzantium or the study of empire.","Fans of Byzantine history will really enjoy this class because you really get to delve deep into the primary sources of the period.  Professor Angelov is a truly fantastic professor who is extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter as well as someone who cares deeply about his students.  Readings average about 100-150 pages per week but since there are only weekly discussion questions and a few response papers, it does not end up being too bad.","This is a decent seminar, the topic can be very interesting and Prof. Angelov is great.  It can bee a lot of reading, and might be more interesting for people who have some background in Byzantine history.","Wonderful course with amazing access and input from a core history faculty member. Would definitely recommend!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
