It does require some dedication to maintaining your cultures and organizing your experiments. But the payoff in terms of the knowledge and expertise obtained from this class  was great.\r\nTake if you are in, or are considering entering a genetics lab. Also take if you want to learn a great deal about RNAi and its discovery; there are a lot of fascinating discoveries in the RNAi field that many other biology classes typically gloss over."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This class was an amazing and challenging opportunity to delve right into real research and make an impact on an active research project. I learned SO much about both genetics and basic lab techniques. The class was small when I took it and so I had the opportunity to work closely with the professor and TF and ask questions. \r\n\r\nWhether or not you've done extensive research or not, you can make the work fit your background. So, if you're looking for a first laboratory experience or just looking to better understand a new field, this is a great option.\r\n\r\nYou will think a lot about classical genetics, but your results and work may break the mold of expectations and will prompt you to logically analyze your data and draw from a great breadth of biologic understanding. \r\n\r\nIn addition to lab, you will closely read a variety of literature in the related field. I really like that my experiments directly contributed to the topics formally taught and discussed in the class portion of MCB 153. \r\n\r\nSTRONGLY consider taking this class over ls100r or a related generic lab course.\r\n\r\nAlso, worms are awesome and fun!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"5.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"1","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MCB 153","course_id":"3552","cat_num":"16796","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MCB 153","course_id":"3552","cat_num":"16796","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MCB 153","course_id":"3552","cat_num":"16796","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
