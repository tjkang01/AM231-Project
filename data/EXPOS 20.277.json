The preceptor tried to make the class slightly easier and more entertaining for freshman, but in doing so sometimes compromised rigor. This actually made the class less interesting.","This is a solid and fun expos. The assignments are occasionally a little unclear, but Lindsay is a good teacher and the final paper is very fun to write.","Although the actually texts were interesting, the classes were boring and the instructor was not very helpful.","You won't be analyzing criminals or solving crime, but the topic allows for lots of research and sources, and Lindsay is really helpful.","The materials used are really wonderful. Be prepared to really analyze and edit your own writing. Crafting essays that are effective and interesting takes a lot of attention, revision, criticism, and work, but the reward is huge. My biggest triumph was learning how to create truly arguable and conflict-oriented theses.","The reading material in this course is extremely interesting. The assignments are pretty straightforward.","Very interesting and engaging class. For a required class, I'd definitely recommend it for the psychology-based and very applicable conversations we had in class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.60","workload":"3.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.60","enrollment":"14","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.277","course_id":"12345","cat_num":"37722","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"4","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.277","course_id":"12345","cat_num":"37722","1s":"4","2s":"6","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
