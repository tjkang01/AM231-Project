It has a lot of reading some weeks...but so is every class!","This course offers a great overview of both the history of various Asian American groups and the factors that have shaped their experience in the US today.","I would \"recommend with reservations\" not because this wasn't a good class - in fact, it was one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. Rather, I could imagine people who are unfamiliar with the concepts presented in class\/unfamiliar with anthropology would struggle. This class was very theory-based and difficult for an undergraduate course. I learned a ton, but sometimes the concepts flew over my head. We had great discussions because mostly everyone was a senior or had vested interest in the topic. This is not a class for someone looking for a casual elective.","It's a really good class with little work.  You need to be able to keep up with the readings and discussion in class, but so long as you have a personal interest in the material, you'll love it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.14","workload":"1.71","difficulty":"2.57","recommendation":"4.14","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 1815","course_id":"171","cat_num":"60047","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 1815","course_id":"171","cat_num":"60047","1s":"2","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 1815","course_id":"171","cat_num":"60047","1s":"3","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
