It's a wonderful excuse to write - the workshop setting lets you exchange feedback with other campus writers with a variety of styles and strengths. The Playwrights Festival is also a blast.","The next playwriting instructor will determine what this class looks like in 2013-2014. But regardless of instructor, the class is a great opportunity to force yourself to write, get valuable feedback from your peers, and have a staged reading of your play performed.","Liz Duffy Adams is such a delight.  The Advanced Playwriting Workshop itself has a satisfying format--critique, workshop, reading, etc.--but the professors really make the course.  Liz is supportive, witty, and insightful.","This class is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have a lot of support and feedback during the process of writing a full-length play, complete with a staged reading at the end of the semester led by a professional director. It felt more like a class for life than a purely academic class. Liz was lovely!","This class allows you to write a play you care about AND have it staged in reading format by a professional director. The playwriting teacher next year will be a new appointment, so talk to your peers about how his Fall classes were, but he is supposed to be strong! (A note on the performance of your play: Be sure to cast it EARLY! Don't scramble to find actors in the last week)","If you want to write a play, you must take this course, because it will force you to finish a play. Liz is gone so do your research on the new guy, but honestly take it anyway\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit's an incredibly valuable experience if you've ever thought about maybe trying your hand at writing."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.29","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"2.71","recommendation":"4.71","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH Canr","course_id":"10605","cat_num":"70584","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH Canr","course_id":"10605","cat_num":"70584","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH Canr","course_id":"10605","cat_num":"70584","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
