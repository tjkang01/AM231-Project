One of the best I've taken at Harvard so far. However, only really suited for people already with a deep interest in the early Soviet period and film. Otherwise, without this deep interest, the amount of work that the class expects you to do each week would not really be worth it. If the interest and language skills are there, the class is just perfect."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.25","workload":"4.00","difficulty":"3.25","recommendation":"4.75","enrollment":"7","response rate":"57.14","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SLAVIC 240","course_id":"4581","cat_num":"52215","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SLAVIC 240","course_id":"4581","cat_num":"52215","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SLAVIC 240","course_id":"4581","cat_num":"52215","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
