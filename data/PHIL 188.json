It allowed for the confluence of detailed, analytical philosophy with discussions about art and expression, and upheld a rigorous standard by which students were to read Proust with a critical mindset.  It made me reflect deeply about my own life, and how I interact with the world and other people in it.  You should take this course.","I really enjoyed this course, even if it is a fair amount of reading each week.","Make sure you really enjoy reading Proust before you take the course. If you do love reading Proust, you will LOVE everything about this class--the readings, the lectures, the papers, section. If you don't, this class might be hard to get through.","the course has been personally intellectually important for me."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"4.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"14","response rate":"64.29","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
