Even though the course meets only once every two weeks, it is crucial for you to start thinking about your thesis topics early on, and I would suggest devoting a few hours each week in order to keep up with the course's progression. In other words, the class is well-structured and helpful, but like any other seminar that meets less often, you should take initiative in order to get the most out of what the course has to offer."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["The more you know about what you want to write your thesis on coming into the program, the better!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"2.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"10","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RSRA 298A","course_id":"4514","cat_num":"108816","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RSRA 298hf","course_id":"4514","cat_num":"14813","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RSRA 298A","course_id":"4514","cat_num":"108816","1s":"2","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
