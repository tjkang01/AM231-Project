You'll read poems in a dozen languages you don't speak, and Professor Giron is a genius. Make sure to take some course with him.","If you are interested in appreciating beautiful love poetry, definitely take this course! Professor Giron-Negron is an amazing lecturer--just listening to him speak is a treat you don't want to miss. This class will expose you to a wide swath of medieval love poetry and give you the freedom to choose which poems beg you to engage deeply with them. This class is good for your soul!","The syllabus is excellent and Professor Negron is remarkably versed in the material- my biggest challenge to new students would be to not be intimidated by his knowledge to the point that speaking up in class doesn't happen... I think the class could have been more engaging if more students had felt comfortable talking out about the poems.","I highly recommend taking Professor Giron Negron's class--he is a great teacher and an expert in middle ages literature.","The course is really interesting and Professor Giron Negron is really fantastic! Take it!"]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["This is a phenomenal course! I knew nothing about poetry and learned how to appreciate some beautiful works more fully. it wasn't a huge time commitment because the readings were selected carefully to address certain aspects of medieval poetry that Pr. Giron Negron wanted to highlight specifically. He can also speak pretty much every language of import and it's beautiful.","Professor Giron Negron is absolutely amazing, and you should take this class just to have an opportunity to hear him speak (always passionately) about the texts. He knows so many different languages that he's able to communicate a feel for the original text, even if you don't speak that language. He provides good historical background and fantastic readings fo these works."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"3.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
