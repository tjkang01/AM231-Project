Although the teachers were both great, the material was less than engaging and the tests were unnecessarily difficult. Take this class only if you are willing to put in a lot of work and read\/memorize a boring textbook.","This class is really useful and probably more interesting than other available courses. Also, you are asked to make presentations (not very stressful, but new and helpful indeed!) a couple times, along with brief analysis of corporate strategies\/advertisement, all of which were very much related to every day life and frankly, less dense than a range of random academic topics (that usually come up in other courses). I wouldn't say it's a very easy class, but it's definitely doable, even if you are not a native Chinese speaker.","Very practical course where the sayings and idioms can be frequently used (as opposed to Chinese 150)","definitely worth taking","If you're interested in gaining some useful and interesting knowledge of both general business terms and a taste of Chinese business culture while also making modest improvements in general language skills (speaking, listening, reading, writing), this course is a solid choice."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["It's fun and useful","Material is not too difficult but the people in the class usually have a high level of chinese. Overall good class, but something to keep in mind.","The first half of the term had a reasonable workload, but the teacher began adding unexpected and rather time-consuming assignments during the last four or five weeks of the semester. Suddenly, we were asked to give extra oral presentations and complete other assignments, all of which were helpful, but difficult to foresee. Some of these assignments were poorly designed. For example, we would be asked to use specialized vocabulary to speak about a topic that was only somewhat related, so it took some mental acrobatics to make things fit together. Not to mention, many of the writing topics did not allow for much creativity. This might be because it was the first time our teacher created these assignments, but it sometimes came off feeling like we were just doing extra work for work's sake. Ye Laoshi was a saving grace, though. His light-hearted teaching style and clear dedication to his students makes us wonder why he is still a drill instructor.","Make sure you can converse in Chinese.","Take it if you want to work in China for internship\/post-grad job","It was amazing. Ye Laoshi and Liu laoshi are the best people in the world. No doubt."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This is an excellent class, for the right student. The breadth is challenging and the pace rigorous (5 classroom hours per week and constant flow of assignments!), but it is well worth the language practice and the specialized vocabulary, as well as valuable business culture lessons. The class uses innovative materials, as well as an excellent textbook, and the professors are patient while demanding. This is a perfect class for students who have moved beyond conversational Chinese and want to improve their specialized context-driven language competency, in a business context.","If you want to learn important cultural and business practices, this is the class to take.  You also end up being comfortable with making presentations in Chinese, which can help you in the future.","An excellent language course, but pretty intense. As someone who had taken first- through third-year Mandarin at Harvard, I found the workload for 163 to be more demanding than any previous Chinese course I'd taken. The teaching staff and the curriculum are fantastic, and your progress will be huge, but it will definitely be a challenge to get there, particularly if you are just coming out of 130.","If you want to take a Chinese class, in my experience this class is much better than the 150 series and more practical if you are not thinking about studying Chinese academically. That said, when I took the class the students in the class had a very broad range of Chinese abilities (due to the loose pre-reqs) so I'd be cognizant of that.","You need to practice using the vocab in ways other than you're shown in class. The teachers help equip you with good tools, but they don't give you the full scope of these tools' uses"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["A lot more work than you anticipate--much of your grade depends on class attendance & participation. You get out of it as much as you put into it.","It's a great class to learn Chinese - regardless of whether you are interested in business.","If you do not know enough about business, you will be confused and fall behind.","An excellent way to learn and practice a specific set of vocab. It's not hard, but it involved A LOT of work! Surprisingly time consuming.","Chinese has never disappointed me at Harvard. Though the workload was a bit heavy at times, this was through and through a great experience.","Some of the work feels like busy work, but overall the class is useful for learning formal and technical words and phrases.","This is a fantastic course, you'll have fun, learn, and do well.","This is a very fun course, that is an extremely easy A. The time spent on the work can vary a lot from week to week, and the teachers like to spring random assignments and presentations on the students out of the blue. Your language ability will definitely improve significantly though.","Great for improving your Chinese-- lots of talking and presenting opportunities. Also, very useful vocab","So much fun!!","The best Chinese class I've taken at Harvard. Much more practical than the other upper-level Chinese classes. I'm not interested in studying obscure idioms or classical Chinese literature, so I thought this was a great class because it focused on teaching practical language skills for business in Chinese-speaking countries. Following the theme in the Chinese department at Harvard, the teachers are amazing and spend a ton of time on the class. The workload is higher than other Chinese classes, however. Quizzes are every Monday and Wednesday, Fridays alternate between tests and 700-character exams, and there are a few pages of additional homework each week on top of that. Most weeks, you'll also have to do other projects ranging from creating powerpoints about business strategies and advertising plans for imaginary Chinese companies to dubbing over a few minutes of a movie of your choice in Chinese. Overall, I'd definitely recommend it and it helped me improve my Chinese."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Try to use the vocabulary as much as possible in presentations, papers, and on exams.","This class is amazing.  It requires a lot of work, but if you've been taking the 120, 130, and\/or 140 series, it should be about on par with what those classes expect of you.  Sun Laoshi is so kind and caring,"]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["I am much more confident in my business Chinese communication skills now after taking the course. I also feel well equipped to practice on my own now with the learning skills I've acquired.","Be prepared to put in consistent work for this class, as there are no major examinations but many smaller assignments that need time to complete.","You should come to class motivated, excited, and creative. The teachers are amazing and you will learn a ton.","One of the best Chinese classes I had so far."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["This was a great Chinese course! Hu laoshi is very dedicated to helping students improve their practical speaking and writing skills and expanding their knowledge of Chinese as a whole. The class atmosphere is quite relaxed, which is conducive to student learning. The workload and exams are very manageable, and you learn a lot about business customs in China. Definitely take it if you are interested in learning more practical Chinese as an alternative to Chinese 150a\/b.","I took this class even though I don't really have an interest in business in China because I needed one more for the citation. Perhaps not the best idea, but it turned out to be pretty good. Hu Laoshi is really great: very organized and focused on helping you learn. At least this semester it was tougher than I expected: met 5 days a week and the other students all had a very high level of Chinese. But you could tailor the class to fit your interests via presentations and essays which you could choose. Overall, a very nice course even if you're not interested in the subject material as much.","This course is fun and covers a good amount of topics, but it moves quickly. I regret not taking a basic economics class before studying Business Chinese because many of the terms we studied I encountered for the first time..in a foreign language. Having taken 140a and b, I felt adequately prepared for the class, but it definitely throws out a lot of new vocabulary terms at you that you may or may not have studied and expects you to know them. That said, I am very pleased with the amount of formal Chinese words and grammar patterns I learned in this class."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["As is expected of any Chinese class, this is a lot of work. The class itself has very different levels of Chinese and the teacher is very forgiving about your work and capabilities. This class is a steep learning curve but if you put in the time and work you can learn a great deal that will be very useful to you should you seek to work professionally in or around China.","If you're planning on working in a Chinese-speaking place in the future, you'll definitely learn a lot of applicable vocabulary and grammar structures in this course. The textbook is a bit outdated (2006) but still has a lot of good stuff in it. Also, Hu Laoshi is just great!","For those who may conduct business (financial, legal, what have you), this course offers a good intro to formal language and business culture","Be prepared to work hard! You learn a lot of technical words whose English meanings you might not be familiar with (especially if you have never studied economics or business). However, the class is very interesting and a great way to keep up your Chinese. In a given week, you prepare characters twice and have either a test or a presentation on Friday (all quite manageable). If Hu Laoshi is teaching it again, definitely take it. He's the best!","Very useful class for students who plan to work or do business in China."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Awesome class in general. My Chinese really improved through this class.","It definitely is the workload of a Chinese class - meeting every day, doing all the assignments, and intermittent work whether it's looking at new vocabulary, studying for an exam or writing a paper. You're always doing something and expected to integrate new knowledge. \r\n\r\nChinese below at least 140a would make this class difficult - 130x series could be a good substitute for requirements.","This is an amazing class- Hu Lao Shi is super funny and down to earth, and the material is relevant and pretty interesting. Just be prepared to spend more time in the course- the homeworks get a little time intensive, but its overall very worth it","This is the best Chinese class Harvard offers. Hu laoshi and Gong laoshi are fantastic. You learn so much useful vocab. Don't leave Harvard chinese without taking this class.","This class is amazing!!! Take if if you're interested in learning business vocabulary. Take it if you're interested in learning formal writing skills (e.g. resume, speeches, contracts). Take it if you want to have fantastic teachers (Hu laoshi and Gong laoshi). Basically take this Chinese class!!! It was a great class to end my last semester at college."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"6.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"11","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHNSE 163","course_id":"775","cat_num":"117085","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHNSE 163","course_id":"775","cat_num":"6558","1s":"1","2s":"8","3s":"8","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHNSE 163","course_id":"775","cat_num":"117085","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
