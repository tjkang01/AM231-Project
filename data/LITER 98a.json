It evolves into a one-on-one conversation of remarkable breadth and depth in which you and an incredibly intelligent PhD candidate discuss your intellectual interests and read anything\/everything you ever wanted to read, and ultimately fine-tunes that medley of interests into a Special Field proposal for the next semester.","It is the greatest course at Harvard; you will discover who you are academically and have a lot of fun in the bargain.","It'll be great.","Take this tutorial (or rather choose comp. lit. as a concentration) if you have interests in multiple fields and would like to study theory as well as literary texts and films. The tutorial allows each student to EXPERIMENT and\/or to concentrate on a specific field throughout the semester. During the weekly seminar, the one-on-one  two hour meeting gives you the chance to have an in depth conversation with only yourself and the tutor which is unparalleled by most all other departments during the junior year. Another advantage is that you may change the syllabus as you go."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.83","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"2.83","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"9","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LITER 98a","course_id":"590","cat_num":"3119","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LITER 98a","course_id":"590","cat_num":"3119","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LITER 98a","course_id":"590","cat_num":"3119","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
