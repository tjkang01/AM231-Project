What seems essential to me, however, is that one be ready to engage with the reading outside of the class with one's peers. Assuming this and a general willingness to put in the work, you have the chance in this class to laugh a lot, sharpen your skills, and to gain a better critical understanding of how your own mind works by questioning closely what constitutes a good argument for someone from a very different time and place."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Watson knows this material very well, in fact he is producing critical-edition of part of Ny\u00c4\u0081yama\u00c3\u00b1jar\u00c4\u00ab which was the basic text for the second half of the semester","If you are an undergraduate, I strongly encourage you to take this course. Don't be intimidated by the grad students -- they are extremely welcoming, and their experience will drastically improve your Sanskrit. Professor Watson is the ideal instructor -- an expert in his field who is also a caring and dedicated teacher.","Be prepared to work hard, and be sure to work with others! Alex is very capable and very willing to help, but you should also make the most of the other intelligent people in the class. Don't worry about not being able to understand everything. No one in the room does!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"6.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"7","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SANSKRIT 201AR","course_id":"4756","cat_num":"117524","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SANSKRIT 201ar","course_id":"4756","cat_num":"9986","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"5","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SANSKRIT 201AR","course_id":"4756","cat_num":"117524","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
