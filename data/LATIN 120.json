Above all else, the material makes this class! The Satyricon doesn't always get the credit it deserves! Plus, who doesn't want to discuss Priapus in a scholarly setting?","Read Petronius.  He deals with the human condition in a hilarious way.  Plus, it's very hard to know exactly what to make of his work, and wrestling with what you think it should be is a good experience to go through.  Too often we are told what to think about art, but Prof. Tarrant doesn't push any specific interpretations, which is awesome.","This class is a great way to explore a work in Latin literature that is notorious but woefully underrepresented. It is primarily discussion based, which makes for some truly interesting conversations about The Satyricon.","This is an enjoyable class, on a Roman novel! and Prof. Tarrant is very good--and nice to be in class with. It is probably a small and informal group. I recommend this.","This is the only exam in recent memory that I have had fun studying for.  If this class is available, take it -- the text is brilliantly funny and vibrant."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"2.60","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LATIN 120","course_id":"5008","cat_num":"44031","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LATIN 120","course_id":"5008","cat_num":"44031","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LATIN 120","course_id":"5008","cat_num":"44031","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
