If you place great import on being able to get your hands dirty while learning science, this is an excellent class for you.","Take this class. If you have any interest whatsoever in primate evolution, anatomy, or fossils, then this class is a wonderful opportunity to explore those interests with a hands-on approach. Prof. Barry is amazing and will work one-on-one with you throughout the course, deepening your connection to the material. You really learn with your hands in this course, which is so refreshing in today's academic system!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"2.80","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HEB 1435r","course_id":"2740","cat_num":"83093","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HEB 1435r","course_id":"2740","cat_num":"83093","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HEB 1435r","course_id":"2740","cat_num":"83093","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
