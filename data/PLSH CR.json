You craft the syllabus but you have to have a solid idea of what you want to read, write about, talk about, watch (movies about history). I would say there was 15-25 pages of academic reading a week and 20 new vocabulary words and definitions gleaned from texts each week. We also turned in written compositions (2-3 type written pages) once a week. Of course, others may propose other formats but that worked well for our advanced group.","Advance your knowledge and use of the Polish language like no other way possible -- take control of your curriculum, and be guided by one of Harvard's best professors, Anna Bara\u00c5\u201eczak."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Pani Bara\u00c5\u201eczak is a true delight.
