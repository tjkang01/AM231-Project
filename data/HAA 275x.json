It is important to be able to see the readings from a variety of different historical and methodological perspectives. I highly recommend the seminar to anyone who is interested in gaining an understanding of German aesthetic theory of the first half century. But more importantly, it will instill a type of critical reading and questioning that will carry over to all future study."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"3.20","difficulty":"4.40","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"11","response rate":"45.45","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 275x","course_id":"2619","cat_num":"71413","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 275x","course_id":"2619","cat_num":"71413","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 275x","course_id":"2619","cat_num":"71413","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
