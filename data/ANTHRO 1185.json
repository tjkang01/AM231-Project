The source material was highly interesting and the class was fantastically engaging. One of my favorite classes taken at Harvard yet it expects a high amount of time. Only take if high interest in the field because of the time required for it.","Working with Professor Cerezo-Roman is truly the reason to take this class. She is very knowledgeable, fun, and engaging. The course reading, however, is VERY, VERY exhausting. It was one of the main downfalls of this course, which otherwise was interesting and hands-on. I learned the most from this class this semester, but the reading expected of students (which is then discussed thoroughly) is far too much."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"8.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 1185","course_id":"12217","cat_num":"89285","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 1185","course_id":"12217","cat_num":"89285","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
