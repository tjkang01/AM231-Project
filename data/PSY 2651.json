The subject matter sounds very specific, but I really think it's a useful way to understand the roots of a lot of fascinating human social dynamics, like cooperation and culture especially.","The course is a great elective in psychology, especially if you are interested in social cognition and comparing work with humans and non-human primates.  Though our class was small, we had a great group which led to really interesting discussions each week.  The workload is manageable.","Maybe the best class I've taken at Harvard. Definitely one to take if you're a junior or senior who wants to explore this topic at a much deeper level than you might get in other classes\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI felt like I was accountable for my work in a way that led me to really grow, but without ever feeling like I was in over my head. Also Felix is just a wonderful person\u00e2\u20ac\u201dA+ class, definitely consider taking it if you feel like you're up for more of a challenge."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 2651","course_id":"4343","cat_num":"31825","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 2651","course_id":"4343","cat_num":"31825","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 2651","course_id":"4343","cat_num":"31825","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
