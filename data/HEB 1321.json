I found the experiments interesting and relevant, while still giving us freedom to answer questions we found interesting. I learned a lot in this class and the expectations of the students in this class were reasonable, letting me learn freely.","This class was offered for the first time this past semester, so the organization naturally still has to be hammered out. However, I recommend this class heartily to anyone semi-interested in nutrition. We read interesting and timely papers, and we experimented on ourselves, which was the coolest part. We tested the accuracy of Fitbits, bomb calorimeters, and food nutrition labels, and for the final paper, we were allowed to come up with our own experiments. Some people tested the isotopes in their urine after drinking a certain brand of water; some people tested their resting metabolic rates after eating raw and cooked food. This was a real treat of a class because it sparked my interest in science again. I really appreciate that this class didn't bog you down in technical detail, unlike other classes. Drs. Tuross and Reynard are also very helpful, approachable, and kind."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"4.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HEB 1321","course_id":"13095","cat_num":"160432","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HEB 1321","course_id":"13095","cat_num":"160432","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
