The course is pretty much a lecture\/seminar hybrid with great film content to talk about. The assignments seem vague, but once you get feedback from the first batch, you'll know what to expect for the next six papers (2-page responses).","Professor Pe\u00c3\u00b1a is SO knowledgable about film and history and the way they have interacted in Latin America over the last century. You learn so much from his lectures. It is generally more lecture-based than discussion, although on Thursdays, after having seen the film for the week at the Wednesday screening, we did have a chance to discuss our thoughts on it, but rather briefly. Because of that lack of disucssion, the readings end up being kind of \"optional,\" but there's lots of cool info about both Latin American filmmakers and also the art of documentary in general that you can peruse at your own pace.","If you are at all interested in documentary filmmaking, take this course. Not only do you get to learn from Professor Pe\u00c3\u00b1a's exhaustive encyclopedic knowledge of the films, you also get to learn about the different modes of documentary. At times the class feels like a history of documentary films through the lens of Latin American features, which really gives a great deal of breadth on top of the depth of the course experience."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"6.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 196D","course_id":"13632","cat_num":"160233","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 196D","course_id":"13632","cat_num":"160233","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
