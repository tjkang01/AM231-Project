You truly feel that he's the top of the field.","Professor Loveluck is a good lecturer and does a great job introducing archeological study to students with no prior background.","Professor Loveluck is fantastic. He really cares about his subject and his students. If you are interested in the formation of England this really is a good course, and archeology provides an interesting lens to study this history.","I would recommend taking this class if you are interested in how archaeologists and historians can learn from each other. I would also recommend taking this class if you are uncertain about pre-modern history but would like to learn more about a time period whose complexity is probably under-estimated by most people. Professor Loveluck has first had experience as an archaeologist, lectures well, and grades fairly.","This is a great, straightforward course about early medieval archaeology. It is very focused in its aims, and I would recommend it to anyone with a passion for medieval history or archaeology - but probably not to outsiders, who might feel a bit lost or apathetic about the dense material.","I loved this class. I had never taken an archaeology based class before but Professor Loveluck made the material incredibly interesting and accessible. It was a fun class that I actually looked forward to every week. If you are interested in the time period 400-1100, I would say it's a must.","This was a great class!  Professor Loveluck is wonderful, and the material is very interesting, although some history students may find it a bit archaeology-heavy.  I really enjoyed it and would recommend it!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"9","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1047","course_id":"13067","cat_num":"160241","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1047","course_id":"13067","cat_num":"160241","1s":"2","2s":"6","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
