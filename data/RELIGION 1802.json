You will learn a LOT and Professor Asani is so accessible and very interested in helping you learn the material. Definitely take it to learn more about not just Sufism, but also religion, culture, and the way that people interact with these topics."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["This course HAS to be taken. Harvard does NOT have enough classes on Islam and this is the only course on Islamic spirituality. So it is a must for all students esp since Sufism was the most dominant form of Islam until quite recently","This is a great way to broaden your horizons and is very accessible even if you have never taken a religion class.","Take this class! So amazing.","I had never conceived of theology and mysticism as merged into a single line of thought: after taking this class, I have a hard time seeing why they shouldn't.","This is an amazing class conducted by one of the most knowledgeable professors on Islam and Sufism at Harvard. Regardless of your Islamic knowledge this class will give you a great understanding of Sufism! Take it!","Do the readings and cite them in your responses! You can get a lot out of this class if you put in the effort."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"5.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 1802","course_id":"5109","cat_num":"3830","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RELIGION 1802","course_id":"5109","cat_num":"3830","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 1802","course_id":"5109","cat_num":"3830","1s":"2","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
