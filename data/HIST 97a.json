Take advantage of each essay assignment and revision. These are the greatest assets this class can offer you."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["The subject is fascinating and you have so much room to explore whatever you're interested in. It's a good deal of work, but all the tutorials are. If you want to do well, you have to be prepared to do a lot of working and figuring things out on your own.","This class seemed as though it would be interesting from the description and the first few meetings. However, it failed to teach us much of anything, either in terms of medical history or regarding how to write different kinds of history papers. Rather than learning about the history of medicine (which is a fascinating topic in itself) or gaining a better understanding of how to write about history, I spent the semester growing increasingly frustrated by a course that generally failed to engage, teach, or interest me, despite my best efforts to enjoy it. Moreover, the grading was extremely harsh and often seemed arbitrary. There were occasional redeeming aspects to the course, such as the field trip to the Countway Medical Library, but, in general, this is not a class that I would recommend.","Professor and TF are great, very interested in the material. Class can drag on but that is just because it is three hours when it only needs to be an hour and a half.","I loved the Professor and the TF! I think it was the best option for the tutorials for sure."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.30","workload":"4.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.40","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 97A","course_id":"10917","cat_num":"109926","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 97a","course_id":"10917","cat_num":"69581","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 97A","course_id":"10917","cat_num":"109926","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
