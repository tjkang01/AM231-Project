You get to see other historians' works in progress, see what sorts of criticism half-formed work generates, and collectively work through difficult questions about the history of capitalism. All the while, you get a full year to work through your own research paper, with lots of feedback from your fellow students and Profs. Beckert and Desan.

It is also quite useful to get to see real scholars from outside Harvard working through their own work -- it also serves as a great model of how real research progresses and what it means to different audiences.","This course is an excellent way to engage with current and upcoming scholarship on the study of capitalism, and students have the opportunity to engage with students across disciplines and schools at Harvard on these issues.  There is a research component to this course, and while excellent support is provided early on, it's up to the student to seek out further support as the semester progresses.
