I'd recommend that the future student very carefully read the materials assigned for each class and work to recognize the meta-critical arcs of the syllabus. I'd also suggest that the future student maintain a bit of distance from the transactions (pedagogical & intellectual) that propel the course forward.  Finally, I'd recommend that the student relish the opportunity to work through a fascinating set of developments in postwar art with one of the most commanding voices in that field."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"3.25","difficulty":"3.75","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"7","response rate":"57.14","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 277z","course_id":"2624","cat_num":"22567","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 277z","course_id":"2624","cat_num":"22567","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 277z","course_id":"2624","cat_num":"22567","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
