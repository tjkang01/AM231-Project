Although the class didn't have many formal assignments, one should devote some time to keeping up with the literature to get the most out of this course.","It's a great introduction\/survey to an important new topic in graph theory. In terms of getting familiar with the topic, this is the best way of going about it.","There are a lot of different ways in which this course can be thought and the first few weeks of the course make a range of papers and books available to you. If you are interested in graph limits theory or extremal combinatorics, make sure to go ahead and read these to gain the most out of the course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.25","workload":"2.43","difficulty":"2.71","recommendation":"4.43","enrollment":"14","response rate":"57.14","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
