This class is a requirement, so just come every session having read the papers, and be prepared to sit through onerous discussions and mediocre lectures.

You are not held responsible for much of the information presented the first 2\/3 of the class which is slightly frustrating. In theory this is because you are writing a development themed grant that pulls from the class material, however, very little from class ended up in my grant. \r\nYou are given ample time to do the grant however a lack of hard deadlines and the lateness of the help sessions will probably lead to a frantic two weeks of writing at the end of the semester.","The lecture portion of this class can afford to be greatly improved.","Even though development is my area of interest, this was my least favorite course.  I learned very little, and most of the students think the class is a joke"]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["If you want to be a developmental neurobiologist, this course will get you psyched up about development.

I really value all the feedback I received along the way. I fee like I came away with a lot from this exercise. It's obvious that a lot of care went into creating and organizing the class. The professors honestly care about creating an effective learning environment. It was my favorite class that I've taken at Harvard thus far.","This course is incredibly helpful in gaining critical thinking and grant writing skills.","Good class overall. I think some of the lectures could be beefed up a bit. The assigned papers are interesting though and the discussions our year were mostly good. You get graded out of a 100 for every discussion class, which I don't think is necessary.  This also encourages people to make useless comments from time to time which is annoying.  The grant in the end is a pain but I guess I can't say I didn't gain anything from doing it.","That the course is pretty time consuming, especially when the grant kicks in, but the material is interesting and to enjoy the lectures.","Although it is difficult and a large time commitment, the course will teach you all about how to write grants."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Lisa Goodrich is extremely dedicated to the class, and it absolutely shows. I highly recommend the course.","This class is an excellent introduction to developmental neuroscience. It is well-run and the discussions are fun.

I had already taken a class that covered very similar material before and still found this class very rewarding.","A useful course even if you aren't interested in development. You will learn methods, how to read papers, how to write critiques, how to present, and how to write grants.","If you're dreading development, you shouldn't.
