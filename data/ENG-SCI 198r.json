You learn about awesome social network analysis.","Great class if you are looking to apply statistical theories into a project which could potentially extend beyond this class. Much more intellectually stimulating than equivalent Stats courses.","its a very fun class and you get to work on solving real world problems which is rewarding","This course is a great chance to learn the basics of statistical analysis (or review the basic). The project component is great for learning to manage big and open access data; students truly use the engineering design algorithm when formulating the project problem and solution. If you are not proactive, do not take this class: it will not teach you anything unless you are willing to learn (and sometimes, teach yourself).","This class covers the statistics part at a brisk pace.  The transition to the project is what makes it really good.  The project this year was ambitious, which is what makes it fun and allows students to develop real world skills while doing something meaningful.","Great class.  You have to be willing to put in the work, but the results will be well worth it.  Making your own tools to analyze data is an exciting skill that has a lot of application after school."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.29","workload":"3.57","difficulty":"3.57","recommendation":"4.57","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENG-SCI 198r","course_id":"10604","cat_num":"66894","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENG-SCI 198r","course_id":"10604","cat_num":"66894","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENG-SCI 198r","course_id":"10604","cat_num":"66894","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
