He is exceedingly helpful in giving advice and offering help. His comments are to the point, smart and very very interesting! It was the event of my week to attend this seminar. I never laughed so much as in this class.","Do not expect this to be an easy course just because you've taken a Middle English component in your undergraduate years. There is a great deal of reading to be done, most of it comprising texts one does not usually encounter. That's what makes the course rewarding, but a lot of hard work."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.70","difficulty":"3.70","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 215","course_id":"10772","cat_num":"24594","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 215","course_id":"10772","cat_num":"24594","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 215","course_id":"10772","cat_num":"24594","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
