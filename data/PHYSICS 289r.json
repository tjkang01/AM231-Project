It is by no means a tradition that is closed -- certainly, I felt welcome there, though I was an unfamiliar face."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Take your senior year.","N\/A","if you are interested in learning about the more formal aspects of this course, Jaffe is a great resource. To really learn the material though, the lectures are not sufficient; you'll probably get lost unless you supplement the lectures with lots of outside readings.","Some people find the material too arcane. Constructive field theory is mostly math --- and there is very little 'physics' you do in class. While Jaffe is fairly complete in his treatment of the material, the lack of reference material or textbook can be frustrating sometimes. \r\n\r\nIn terms of workload, we had only four psets without any tests.
