Great readings.","Get ready for something really intense.","There is a ton of reading and discussions happen at a very high level, but it is an interesting course.","It's tough (there is a lot of reading and the discussion is very sophisticated) but it's a really good class. It's a unique way to approach the material and very productive to put the Russian and German avant garde side by side. The 1\/3 undergrad 2\/3 grad breakdown can occasionally be frustrating because it's difficult to get basic questions answered\/clarified and you are basically at the mercy of what the graduate students want to talk about.","Really fabulous class, great discussion"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.45","workload":"3.09","difficulty":"4.18","recommendation":"4.36","enrollment":"16","response rate":"68.75","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 176m","course_id":"2584","cat_num":"69109","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 176m","course_id":"2584","cat_num":"69109","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"5","5s":"4"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 176m","course_id":"2584","cat_num":"69109","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"3","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
