The great point about this course is that everyone is at the same start point at the beginning of the class because there are not many people who are familiar with the topic. Interaction between undergraduates and grad students was great too (ratio was about 4:6). If you are interested in music more than 1000 years ago, take it!","This is a great, highly interactive introduction to chant performance and historical musicological (and in a sense, ethnomusicological, even though the informants are mostly manuscripts created by people who are no longer alive) research. Even if you don't plan to go into historical musicology, I feel like I learned a lot about music and research from this course. There course was front- and end- loaded with readings, but the middle of the course was not too demanding. Definitely recommend to anyone, especially music concentrators looking to fulfill the topics in musicology requirement.","By the end of this class, you will be able to read Medieval music notation!","If you are interested in music history, there is perhaps no one better to study from at Harvard than professor Thomas Forrest Kelly. He is so kind and makes the subject of chant come alive for the class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"4.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"8","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MUSIC 191RTKC","course_id":"11041","cat_num":"109716","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"MUSIC 191RTKC","course_id":"11041","cat_num":"109716","1s":"7","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
