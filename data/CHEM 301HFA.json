For what it's worth, it's sort of nice to have the class together and teaching can be fun.  Don't freak out over the assignments.  The class is really there to help you.","The course was helpful in that it gave me a good overview of how teaching works at Harvard. It was also a useful forum to get feedback on teaching and to give it to your peers. That said, I had TA'd before at an undergrad institution similar to Harvard, in that TAs (not professors) teach sections and labs. Given how versed I was with teaching, I was often a bit bored and didn't receive useful feedback aimed at helping me improve. For someone who has never taught much though, I could see this course being very useful.","The class is not much workload. It is a fun experience.","It is a relatively useful intro to teaching. The way it is set up is really only relevant to first year graduate students.","Please enjoy this course since it is a good oportunity to know your classmates.","It's very reassuring to know they don't throw you to the wolves for your teaching assignment.","This class is designed to bring to your attention weaknesses in your abilities as an instructor. It was presented well, provided multiple examples of good teaching and offered suggestions to better oneself.","It is very helpful for people who has no teaching experience or new to American classroom. It will give you sense how to behave and how to prepare for being a teaching assistant."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Getting an intro to teaching is good, but for people that have taught before it may not be helpful","Take advantage of your last weeks before starting research.  Don't come back until classes start or you'll regret it.","This class will give you feedback on your teaching and provide you with useful hints and tips to succeed as a college instructor.","It could be useful if you don't have previous experience with teaching a class","Good Luck"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Take it seriously and you'll get more out of it.","useful for students who will be teaching","This course is madatory anyway, so I can't really tell anything about it.","I would tell them that it is low-key, and that you learn a few genuinely useful bits of information (about discrimination in the classroom, for instance)."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This course appears exists so that the chemistry department can cover any possible liability issues while sorting students ostensibly on \"teaching ability\" but actually on proficiency with english. It's going to suck and you have to take it but fortunately, the professors don't care so it's extremely easy.","Have fun.","This course basically didn't exist this semester. See evaluation from last semester."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["A great chance to see you cohort once a week and also to learn something about teaching and how things work at Harvard.","I often forgot I even had this class.","It is a requirement of CCB graduate students. It isn't much work, but there really isn't much benefit. It seems like an easy way for the department to say they taught us how to be TFs without actually teaching us anything.","It's mandatory anyway...","It is useful for developing teaching skills and understanding how the department operates.","This course is not too difficult, but may be very useful to you if you have never taught before. I would recommend putting time into preparing for the various teaching assignments in the course, because that's what will make the course worthwhile."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["The second semester portion of this course is low work but high gain. It consists of a few conversations with course staff about how your teaching is going. I found these meetings to be interesting and useful.","It's a good course for getting the feel of teaching, but don't expect them to tell you how to do things-- just expect to hear how not to do things."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["It's a great way to get an introduction to how to be a good teacher (from some of the best teachers around) before getting started with teaching yourself.","Chemistry 301 is an introduction to becoming a teaching fellow at Harvard.  The class offers opportunities to become comfortable teaching by practicing in a relaxed environment with fellow chemistry graduate students.","be open! and confident!","It's useful to practice before starting the real teaching.","Good for students who have no experience in teaching, but boring and redundant for those with any experience.","It's certainly easy to put minimal effort in this class, but I suggest that you don't \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is a great way to improve your teaching in a low-key environment, so definitely use it! You can definitely put effort in without it being too stressful. It's also nice to see everyone in your cohort regularly :)","Take it seriously!","This class gets students to talk about science in front of a class, which is an important first step in developing sound teaching skills.  What you get out of this class will be directly proportional to what you put into it."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["You'll learn a lot and become a much better presenter\/teacher.","Take the teaching activities seriously because they're a good opportunity to practice your teaching and get helpful feedback.","Required course for G1 CCB students, but it definitely is wonderful to have staff provide constructive feedback about one's teaching. I also enjoyed how the staff were very friendly and encouraging and not mocking.","It's easy to spend little time preparing or involving oneself in this course, but the more time you invest, the more you get out of it. It's largely for your own benefit","You will receive very good feedback about your teaching skills.","Try to get the most out of the microteaching assignments and take the time to prepare for them as if you were actually teaching the course so that you can get back the most representative feedback for your teaching."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"1.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"27","response rate":"85.19","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHEM 301HFA","course_id":"515","cat_num":"124905","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"10","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHEM 301hf","course_id":"515","cat_num":"9903","1s":"10","2s":"4","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHEM 301HFA","course_id":"515","cat_num":"124905","1s":"15","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
