It's tough, but really cool.","For anyone who is interested in the subject matter, I recommend this class without reservation or hesitation. The class is very small (it was this year, anyways) and lectures feel a lot more like a conversation with the professor Koellner. Problem sets are reasonable, and the subject matter is really interesting and well-explained. Often I leave a math class feeling like I have a surface understanding of the material, enough to do the homework but not a particularly deep understanding. Math 145a did not feel this way at all. Overall a great class.\n\nAlso, forcing is insanely cool."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"6.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MATH 145a","course_id":"12497","cat_num":"95052","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"MATH 145a","course_id":"12497","cat_num":"95052","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
