Unfortunately, I don't think that the other students were particularly engaged in this subject and therefore the quality of the class discussions was very low. I also do not think that the discussions were particularly well guided and could have definitely benefited from a more assertive leader. Finally, I do not think that the readings were not particularly well selected, which also detracted from the quality of the disucssions.","I was really disappointed with this class. This class was a huge source of frustration for me. I felt that the teacher didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really care about the class\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe admitted to not preparing for class and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really moderate discussion or involve people but spent most of class time talking about irrelevant things. The students also weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t engaged or interested in the subject topic\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t participate and were constantly on their computers. Students led class discussions on readings, which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helpful when the person in charge and the other students didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do the readings. Instead of discussing or elaborating on the readings in depth, the teacher would ask about how google forms worked or if people used their Facebook statues to talk about political issues. We had to go around and constantly update each other on our final project research, but we would spend an hour each time doing that, which took up most of the class and kept us from discussing or learning any central ideas or themes from the class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"40.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOCIOL 98Ha","course_id":"4638","cat_num":"57732","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOCIOL 98Ha","course_id":"4638","cat_num":"57732","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOCIOL 98Ha","course_id":"4638","cat_num":"57732","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
