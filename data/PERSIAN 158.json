He even went beyond the call of duty to offer extra Persian metrics classes, which are absolutely crucial to understanding Persian literature and poetry, and the transition from classical forms to modern ones. Persian metrics should be a core part of any Persian literature course, and I am very grateful that Professor Ahmed gave us an extra hour a week on metrics, and is even continuing to give us extra courses now after classes have officially ended. I enjoyed very much reading the Persian texts and translating them in class, and again at home -- this is a crucial part of any student's training in Persian. He is also very patient with all of us in class, who are coming in at different levels and different commitment levels (we have auditors too). However, he was able to control the class and proceed at a pace that was comfortable for everyone."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Anyone who is interested in Persian language and literature will enjoy this course. Both the reading materials and the professor's ability to teach this course are amazing."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PERSIAN 158","course_id":"13827","cat_num":"159766","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PERSIAN 158","course_id":"13827","cat_num":"159766","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
