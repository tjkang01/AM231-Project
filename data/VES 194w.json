Don't take this class.","Fun class that will change how you see film.","The films you watch are great but the class is disorganized and uninteresting."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["This class was wonderful, even if you aren't a VES concentrator.  However, it took much more time to prepare for each week than expected (3 group presentations, 6 response papers, weekly movie screenings as well as readings)","Come with a love for film, leave with the technical vocabulary and critical viewpoint necessary to view films and appreciate them on a deeper level. Highly recommended for those who would like a broad overview of international art-house film.","This class is awesome!","This is a fantastic course which sparks lively discussions. Heavily based in student-led discourse, Prof. Bluher incites independent thinking. The thought-provoking nature of this course leads the students to strongly develop their analytical skills.","This class is a lot of work but at the same time you will be exposed to some amazing films. I feel like I learned to see films in a different way, and now experience them on a much deeper level. It is a big time commitment though, just be aware.  But film analysis can be really fun.","Try to get an early start with the final paper."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.07","workload":"2.21","difficulty":"2.50","recommendation":"4.07","enrollment":"17","response rate":"82.35","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 194w","course_id":"5239","cat_num":"4865","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 194w","course_id":"5239","cat_num":"4865","1s":"2","2s":"3","3s":"9","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 194w","course_id":"5239","cat_num":"4865","1s":"1","2s":"10","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
