He is an encyclopedia of knowledge and if he is able to, he is willing to help in office hours. It would be ideal if he could lecture and teach more, because a good portion of the class includes a student presenting, but he will sometimes provide his input or provide useful references and information about related issues in the middle of the presentation, which is good."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["It is a joy to learn from Professor Mottahedeh."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"33.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 2886","course_id":"2511","cat_num":"113048","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 2886","course_id":"2511","cat_num":"3470","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 2886","course_id":"2511","cat_num":"113048","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
