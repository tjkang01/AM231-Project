Imagine the thesis writing process is like one's first relationship: you and your highschool sweetheart figure things out on your own. \r\n\r\nThe department's role in the thesis writing process, however, was fairly disorganized. The head tutor was slow in responding to questions, especially in returning comments on writing, and had little knowledge about the process of submission and grading.\r\n\r\nStill, write a thesis, its great!","We did not receive much guidance in the second semester tutorial, and only met once right before theses were due.","Overall, writing a thesis was very stressful, but also very rewarding. You should start early. If you leave the bulk of your thesis until mid-February, finishing it by the deadline is possible (living proof right here), but be prepared to do little other than write until it is due\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand it won't be enjoyable. Also, if you need to get IRB approval to work with human subjects, start that process as early as possible!","Writing a thesis is a very rewarding process, but the linguistics department has some work to do in facilitating that process.
