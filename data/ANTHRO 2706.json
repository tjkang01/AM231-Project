The professor is encouraging and open-minded, and I felt free to take intellectual risks.","A great introduction to ideas in medical anthropology and the overlooked ways that ideas about the body and disability, disease are produced by racial, economic, and other socio-political factors.","The course has interesting and diverse readings. The class discussion largely depends on the students.","The readings and subject matter were quite interesting.  The discussions, however, sometimes felt like a rehashing of predictable critiques.","A great course if you have an interest in medical anthropology and enjoy talking about it.  You'll get out what you put in."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["it's good; the professor is nice","Do the readings, because the class discussions are really interesting, and you'll want to be able to follow what other people are saying.","this class was unbelievable. i went in very timid as it is an upper level anthro class with a lot of grad students and i had never taken an anthro class before. as long as you are interested in the intersection of heath and race\/gender, you will absolutely thrive in this class. the readings are increcible--not too much reading at all. the weekly response papers really get you thinking. and Professor Ralph is probably the brightest guy I've ever met. definitely take this class.","I enjoyed this course although I think that coming from some other \"health focused\" courses, I was a bit surprised that there was not more of a focus on specific disabilities and the body."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 2706","course_id":"220","cat_num":"87741","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 2706","course_id":"220","cat_num":"87741","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 2706","course_id":"220","cat_num":"87741","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
