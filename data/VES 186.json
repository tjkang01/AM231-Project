You are the character. And Professor Casetti guides your arc. It's a lot of difficult thinking, not necessarily a lot of work.","this course won't be offered again since Professor Casetti was just visiting for a semester, but it was totally bonkers and awesome.","This does not feel like your traditional class, but only in the best way. It is very personal, and you are always challenged each lecture.","Good things:\r\n\r\n1. Fascinating readings. Fascinating concepts. Each week's topics could probably have a thesis written about them.\r\n\r\nBad things:\r\n\r\n1. Not their fault, but had a very hard time understanding Casetti's very thick Italian accent, and TF's French one. \r\n\r\n2. HE NEVER ANSWERS EMAILS. I tried to do my final paper early because I knew that I was going to have multiple things due on the same day. I tried emailing him and meeting with him over and over....I just submitted my final paper for the semester. he still has not approved of my topic.\r\n\r\n3. TF and Professor contradicted eachother CONSTANTLY. TF was not helpful because she was scared of telling students wrong things, and Casetti seemed extremely absent mentally from this course and his students.","An extremely interesting class combining intellectual curiosity with reflection from daily experiences with media."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"4.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"16","response rate":"81.25","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 186","course_id":"12739","cat_num":"156276","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"6","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 186","course_id":"12739","cat_num":"156276","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
