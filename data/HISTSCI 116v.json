He expects you to engage in the discussion at the same level as the graduate students in the course, which is virtually impossible for someone without much renaissance history background.  In the papers, you must use every source, and I often found myself sacrificing an argumentative, original thesis for one which could incorporate more readings (which I think defeats the purpose of a writing assignment)","Prepare to work hard","Prof Moran is a great teacher. He's very knowledge and patient, and knows how to guide students into this complicated but definitely  fascinating historical world.","An excellent investigation of a crucial topic in the history of science, led with overwhelming competence and enthusiasm by a senior scholar in the field."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.14","workload":"2.43","difficulty":"3.57","recommendation":"4.43","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HISTSCI 116v","course_id":"2646","cat_num":"37703","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HISTSCI 116v","course_id":"2646","cat_num":"37703","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HISTSCI 116v","course_id":"2646","cat_num":"37703","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
