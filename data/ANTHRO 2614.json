This course offers a wonderful reading list of theorists discussing sexuality, which is not present in many other courses on campus. Moreover, Professor Meiu is an expert in this field who makes in-class discussion a productive endeavor. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in sexuality and its role in the modern world.","Worth it just to see Prof. Meiu's mind at work, but also how to incorporate critical theory and psychoanalysis into anthropology (or vice versa).","It's a good course particularly if you are interested in methodological and philosophical questions regarding subjectivity and social theory.","This course exposes the way in which different concepts: politics, race, economics, are melded with sexuality. It is very enlightening and the professor offers deep insights to the subject in very dynamic ways. Take it!","This is, without question, the best class that I have taken at Harvard. The literature covered is varied and engaging. The teaching is excellent - the professor is approachable, lectures well, and facilitated some fascinating class discussions. I have recommended this class to several students already, many not in anthropology, and all have expressed enthusiasm at taking this class. A wonderful seminar.","Be prepared to grapple with dense theory--it's rewarding and valuable for one's academic growth but very challenging.","For Professor Meiu's class: this class is one of the best that I've taken at Harvard. Professor Meiu is very nice and supportive. Classroom environment is intense and fast-paced, but the professor does a great job in summarizing main points, following-up with more questions an comments, and pulling things back on track."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"7.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"22","response rate":"72.73","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 2614","course_id":"12821","cat_num":"156677","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"11"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 2614","course_id":"12821","cat_num":"156677","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
