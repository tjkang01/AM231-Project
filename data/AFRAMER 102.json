This course is mad easy--no section, no weekly response papers even--so if you take this to be an easy class, you definitely won't be disappointed. However, if you have a genuine interest in the subject, you are likely to be disappointed. Being assigned a fascinating set of readings then sitting through a 2 hour lecture delivered in a monotone was terrible. And since there's no section, the only time you discuss readings if you happen to take this class with a friend and then discuss course themes outside of class. Unacceptable.","This class is very interesting and the workload is very manageable.  If you have even the slightest interest in hip-hop, or want to learn more about the politics of hip-hop, this is a phenomenal class to take.","Have an open mind to the potential of hip hop to open up your mind"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.86","workload":"1.75","difficulty":"2.40","recommendation":"4.19","enrollment":"26","response rate":"80.77","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AFRAMER 102","course_id":"33","cat_num":"56863","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"13","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AFRAMER 102","course_id":"33","cat_num":"56863","1s":"1","2s":"10","3s":"9","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AFRAMER 102","course_id":"33","cat_num":"56863","1s":"7","2s":"11","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
