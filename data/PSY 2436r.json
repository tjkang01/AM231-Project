hard work you pour into the lab","Put in effort at the beginning of this course. That's when you're unsure and you don't know the ropes -- learn them, and get involved (REALLY involved) in the things that interest you. Take on a project you're not sure you can do. Things will become more manageable as the semester\/year progresses, and you will be involved in the most rewarding projects. Don't wait and end up doing less interesting things."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["This course does require you to be proactive about learning the material and taking on responsibilities. It's a great place to learn about schizophrenia, but it is up to you to ask questions to get that knowledge.

Everyone is friendly, will explain things to you (not just how to do things but the point of doing them and how it's impacting the field).

The graduate students make working in the Hooker Lab an incredibly positive experience. Sarah, Steven, and the rest of them are incredibly good-hearted and amazing teachers.

If you are looking to simply gain more research experience, this is a great lab. A little disorganized but you get a good sense of what research is like. Definitely ask before starting what your responsibilities as an undergraduate research assistant would be since it varies dramatically based on what stage they are at in their projects (e.g. recruitment may involve calling and screening families, running subjects may involve a lot of working with subjects and administering questionnaires, but if the project is over data analysis might not be your cup of tea)."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"1.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"6","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 2436r","course_id":"4324","cat_num":"9962","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 2436r","course_id":"4324","cat_num":"9962","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 2436r","course_id":"4324","cat_num":"9962","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
