It was a small class, so there was a lot of room for engagement with the materials, and a very manageable workload.","Great lectures on a very interesting time and place. Too much presentation, though.","Don't do what I did and wait until Senior year to take a class in this department!!! It's such a nice, welcoming, fun, and exciting department at Harvard that will offer an enriching elective contribution to your degree if you're not a Celtic Studies person. Beyond that, Professor Innes is a great lecturer and the material is fun, fascinating, and will make you rethink historical\/cultural trends beyond Ireland and Scotland. You'll want to go to Ireland\/Scotland after you take this... or at least go grab a pint of Guinness!","If you're interested in the medieval\/early modern history\/histories of Scotland and Ireland, by all means take this course! The exposure provided really IS amazing; you will learn a lot about the history of these two nations. Prof. Innes is also endowed with a wonderful sense of humor, which makes the class very fun indeed!","It's a lot of fun and the teacher is great."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This is a great class for looking at Gaelic history, mostly the history of their literary development and learned orders and how all of this was affected by the coming of the Saints, Normans, and English throughout the medieval and early modern history of Ireland and Scotland.  Prof. Gillies knows so much about these subjects so learning from him is very beneficial."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"2","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CELTIC 118","course_id":"441","cat_num":"34022","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CELTIC 118","course_id":"441","cat_num":"34022","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CELTIC 118","course_id":"441","cat_num":"34022","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
