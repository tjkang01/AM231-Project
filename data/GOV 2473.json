You get to learn a ton of very good papers and listen to Jim Snyder talk about how to make contributions to studying political parties and interest groups.","Excellent class. Good selection of readings, but few enough in a given week that they can be read well and a good discussion about them can occur, with everyone's involvement.","A great class to take with Jim.","This was one of the best seminars I've taken. Jim does a great job at choosing interesting readings.","This is a really interesting class that addresses some big questions in American politics.","Jim is absolutely amazing and so incredibly knowledgeable (and teaches so well -- I could listen to him for hours). This is a fun and rewarding class where you will get what you put in. The readings were very thought provoking and offered a good balance of perspectives on political parties and interest groups. Be prepared with a more quantitative background to fully appreciate the papers. The final paper is also super fun since there is so much freedom to explore a topic you really care about. Also undergrads be forewarned that this class is all grad students (although this made the class especially rewarding since I got to learn from people who know so much more than I do)."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"5.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"9","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 2473","course_id":"10902","cat_num":"32723","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 2473","course_id":"10902","cat_num":"32723","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 2473","course_id":"10902","cat_num":"32723","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
