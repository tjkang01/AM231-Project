However, I would recommend taking it pass\/fail.","Great course. Surveys literature on entrepreneurship. Note this isn't a class on \"how to become an entrepreneur.\" Josh and Bill are incredibly knowledgable and well connected. I always loved going to class and just hear them talking for 3 hours. Workload is manageable. Don't let the fact that this course number is in the 2000s scare you away.","Not too heavy on workload and has some very knowledgeable professors who are passionate about the material. Definitely take if you are looking at understanding entreprenuership in a little more detail","frankly, class time is boring and adds no additional value to just reviewing the lecture slides that are distributed via email.","Gemmy","Pretty great class! Many of us from the college took, unfortunately pass\/fail because we weren't sure of grading but in retrospect should have taken this for a grade. Really solid lectures and interesting professors. Have to be self-driven and self-directed though or you will not be that engaged.","Undergrads: if you have any interest in the economics of entrepreneurship, take this course. The workload is 1 referee report (3-4 hours of work) every 2-3 weeks, and a final paper proposal (10 pages where you propose a paper you might write about). No final, midterm, or psets. People new to the literature don't realize that Josh Lerner and Bill Kerr are legends in this field; having access to them is an incredible benefit to you. The professors are very open to students taking this class pass\/fail."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"19","response rate":"73.68","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 2726","course_id":"1079","cat_num":"4451","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 2726","course_id":"1079","cat_num":"4451","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 2726","course_id":"1079","cat_num":"4451","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
