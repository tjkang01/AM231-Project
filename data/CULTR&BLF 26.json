I'd definitely recommend shopping it first.","You'll love this course, Prof Bol and Prof Szonyi are great lecturers and the workload is not strenuous.","This will be one of the most fun classes you will take at Harvard--not only for the unique way  it approaches the concept of \"culture,\" but for the amazing dynamic between the two instructors that makes every lecture memorable.","Five weeks of a lot of work, but an enjoyable class nonetheless.","This course does a good job at providing a very interesting history of China by focusing on a specific place over a long period of time. It does not get into any one thing particularly deeply and depends a lot of lectures and trusting the Professors to guide you through the narrative. Readings are interesting, but not necessarily helpful to the course. Grading was tough, but once you understand what is expected it becomes slightly easier. Class did rely on some discussion, though could have been better with more.","It's an interesting class but be prepared to write 5 (or 6 if you write the optional one) papers throughout the term.","There is very little work in this class-- look at the projects in advance and choose ones that you think you would enjoy\/are easy, and space them out across the semester. Get started early and you won't have to worry about any work for the class later on!","It's awesome.","The projects are great! However, for some lectures it's difficult to figure out the main takeaway point for the day"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.89","workload":"2.32","difficulty":"2.68","recommendation":"4.05","enrollment":"21","response rate":"90.48","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CULTR&BLF 26","course_id":"1942","cat_num":"8733","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"5","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CULTR&BLF 26","course_id":"1942","cat_num":"8733","1s":"2","2s":"5","3s":"10","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CULTR&BLF 26","course_id":"1942","cat_num":"8733","1s":"3","2s":"8","3s":"7","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
