You will learn so much about so many different traditions, not just Christianity.  You will be asked to write frequent papers, but you will be encouraged to follow your own interests at every turn, and you will be guided by an absolutely superb professor and TF.  Catherine Brekus seems to know just about everything there is to know about American religious history, which is obviously a huge field.  But she is just as distinguished as a teacher as well.  She leads class discussions with aplomb, engaging everyone's interests, and is very helpful as students explore research topics for their final papers.  Helen Kim was also a wonderful TF, consistently knowledgeable and enthusiastic about so much of the course material.  Overall a fantastic learning experience!","The readings are substantive, but the written assignments are reasonable and Professor Brekus is lovely as a Professor and great at leading discussion sections.","Professor Brekus and Helen are so great! So many entertaining stories and a great class atmosphere. The class and readings give a pretty comprehensive survey of women in a diverse spread of religious traditions in North America and will certainly challenge preconceived notions of the intersections between women's rights, feminism, and the church (and synagogue, mosque)."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"7.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 1019","course_id":"12693","cat_num":"156253","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"9","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 1019","course_id":"12693","cat_num":"156253","1s":"2","2s":"14","3s":"5","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
