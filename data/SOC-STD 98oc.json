The class has great readings and also is a helpful review of some of the people we read in social studies 10. If you are planning to write a thesis on a topic that is related to this, then I fully recommend it. Prof. Bernstein is a really nice lady too.","If you're interested in religion take it. I got lotteried in so I found that my interests weren't always aligned with the class so it was a bit harder to motivate myself to get through some of the denser readings. Then again, most of my complaints are with the Social Studies dept and not with this class specifically so I'll save that rant for another time."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["If you are a junior in social studies who really enjoys exploring issues of religion and secularism, then take this course!","This class is great if you have an interest in religion\/secularism and Professor Bernstein was extremely knowledgeable on the topic."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This class teaches you to think about religion in a whole different way. It is interesting to examine the theory of it and examine it in practice through various case studies.","I would recommend this course with reservations. I think that the subject matter is interesting and engaging but my tutorial did not live up to my expectations for discussion. Thus, I think that if there is a good group of students who are putting in the effort, the class will really succeed. I also think this could be achieved if Professor Bernstein works a little bit more to ensure more participation and buy in."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.00","workload":"5.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.50","enrollment":"4","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOC-STD 98OC","course_id":"11154","cat_num":"109964","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOC-STD 98oc","course_id":"11154","cat_num":"21793","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOC-STD 98OC","course_id":"11154","cat_num":"109964","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
