day.  Other than that, there's no real reason to take it unless you just happen to be interest in the theories behind second language acquisition.","This class did not very strongly address the main points outlined in its description, namely \"theoretical models, learning objectives, developmental stages, materials design, and the use of new technology in teaching.\"","A pretty painless course--and one which will improve greatly with a few tweaks.","Perhaps the best value class at Harvard -- absolutely painless, meets once a week, almost no busy work, simple course requirements, and a LOT of learning all together.","to take it while they are teaching and not before the do so, because then it is hard to follow and recognise the problems that are discussed.","I would suggest this course to those who have some experience studying or teaching foreign languages and were intrigued by the process.

Steven is a great and knowledgeable professor and structured a really rich and stimulating course, and yet, most of us felt that it overwhelmed us more than it actually helped us, as these evaluations will surely corroborate. The number of assignments, while meant to replace a midterm and final, ended up being far too excessive given that most of us were teaching for the first time and preparing for our general exams. But what good will this advice do since you'll just be forced to take this unhelpful class anyway? I will say that Steven's insistence on defending cognitive linguistics\/outdated pedagogical practices was a bit off-putting and got a little annoying after a while. We understand that it's his field but most if not all of us came in hoping to learn the most cutting-edge theories and approaches and were ultimately disappointed. That said, Steven's focus on professionalization was welcome and insightful. Hopefully your experience will be more helpful and less disappointing than it was for this year's LING 200 cohort...","Very good introduction to linguistics and pedagogy."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["If you plan to a language teacher for non-native speakers, this course will equip you with teaching approach, method and strategies you can apply in your classroom.","If you are determined to teach languages in the future, this course would be the best opportunity to learn.
