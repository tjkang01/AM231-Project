Julia and Aline-Florence are friendly, knowledgeable, and eager to help. The topic of the class itself, the story of Weimar, is both historically rich and highly relevant to the contemporary political situation in Europe. I learned a lot and feel much more grounded in my understanding of Germany in the WWI-WWII era.","This research class was engaging, challenging, enjoyable, and intriguing all thrown into one. Even though Julia was new, she really empowered each student to pursue their interest while also learning about the period at large. The readings were, mostly, fascinating, and the final paper acts as a challenge, but is a triumph once you write it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.75","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 82o","course_id":"2365","cat_num":"19432","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 82o","course_id":"2365","cat_num":"19432","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 82o","course_id":"2365","cat_num":"19432","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
