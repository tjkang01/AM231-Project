Its low stress, but you still feel like you've learned a great deal.","This is an absolutely fascinating course, and you learn so much so quickly! The course is extremely enjoyable and if you have any interest in perception at all, I highly recommend it!","The field of visual science is exciting and interesting. The information is well-presented and students who take the class will understand themselves and the world differently after learning about the nature of perception and imagination.","Justin is incredibly knowledgeable about perception and psychology in general, and does a great job of relating class topics to the wider world. There is lots of time for interesting class discussion, and the reading load is very reasonable.","It's a close-knit, fun and thought-provoking sciencey psych for the less sciencey psych concentrator."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"2.90","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 1150","course_id":"11331","cat_num":"1199","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 1150","course_id":"11331","cat_num":"1199","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 1150","course_id":"11331","cat_num":"1199","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
