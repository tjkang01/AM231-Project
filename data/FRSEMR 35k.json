Ms. Lee is a saint, and we were all honored to be taught by such a brilliant professor! The readings were all beautiful, and you will feel much more well-read by the end of the course.","The seminar my semester was very small, though I'm unsure of what the size will be next semester. Be prepared for discussions that are very deep and intimate.","Definitely take it! This class was my favorite of the semester, and it made me rethink what I wanted to concentrate in. This class was so rewarding, and I feel that I improved as a student because of this class. I always looked forward to the readings. They were always very fun, and discussing them in class with Professor Lee is awesome. I couldn't have asked for a better professor. Take this class! You will not be sorry!","A lot more work than other freshmen seminars, but if you're interested in the topic and English in general I would recommend!","This course has been my favorite this semester. The readings, the assignments, the class discussions, and the atmosphere in class made it simply unforgettable. I loved this class a lot, and I strongly recommend everyone to take it!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"2.70","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 35k","course_id":"10813","cat_num":"85328","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 35k","course_id":"10813","cat_num":"85328","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 35k","course_id":"10813","cat_num":"85328","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
