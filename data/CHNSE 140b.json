You'll love her.","I would only recommend this course if the student has a genuine love of Chinese.  140 is the only option to continue Chinese after 130 (Except for 142 which is only conversational and is not known to be a rigorous, stimulating class).  However, 140 truly frustrates students who have been in the Chinese classes from the beginning (Ba\/Bb or Aab), and it is truly unfortunate because these are the students who love the language and love the department and who have put forth immense effort to reach 140 only to be severely disappointed, frustrated and discouraged.","make sure you really want to learn Chinese before you take this course, as you will be contributing significant energy and time to the course.","Fun and useful class.

It would benefit students intending to use Chinese in business or research or whatever other profession than students who want to deeply understand the language. \r\n\r\nA major problem with the class is that it does not discern between good writing and bad writing. It teaches clumsy and even awkward sentence structures. Some academic articles we read in class are written so terribly that they should never be examined and picked to represent Chinese writing.","If you are a heritage speaker, expect big improvements in listening, speaking, and writing. The reading portion was weak because we tried to cover a lot of text.","If you haven't learned some Chinese yet, what are you waiting for?","It's a wonderful class.

She's so kind and funny, and she treats each of her students like her children. You learn a lot about societal\/sociological issues in China and also about various genres of Chinese literature. Because it's a course primarily about language, it's mostly a survey of these topics with lots of vocab thrown at you, so don't expect to explore the topics too deeply, but it's tons of fun nonetheless. I took AP Chinese and spent a summer abroad in China and I thought the class was really manageable.","This class is a natural continuation of Chinese 140a and is similar in workload and content to it.

She's very energetic, responds quickly to questions via e-mail, and just a wonderful person to get to know. I would say that my speaking ability did not improve as much in Chinese 140 as it did when I took Chinese 130x, but that's because there's a greater emphasis on formal writing in Chinese 140. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend taking Chinese 140 if you would like to further your Chinese language skills!","Great continuation of 140a.

This makes every class exciting and super relevant.","This is a great class where you learn a lot and really fine tune your language skills. There are quite a few native speakers who take this class, so it can be pretty overwhelming at first for people who have no background speaking Chinese at home. Requires a good amount of time but it's pretty straightforward what you need to do to do well, it just comes down to putting in the time and effort.","This class is a good follow-up to Chinese 140a. There are no surprises in terms of what to expect, as it is structured just like the other Chinese classes. I think at this level, improvement of Chinese just depends on how willing you are to put in the effort. The class can become a bit dry at times.","This is a rigorous course. The material can feel challenging at times, particularly at the beginning of the course and there is a bit of a jump between Chinese140a and b in terms of the level of content. Expect to put in a lot of hours. But it is definitely worth it if you've come this far.","You should know by now what the Chinese program is all about; wouldn't say this class is any more difficult than previous years","This class is a step up in work from Chinese 140a: the dictations are more difficult, homework takes longer, and assignments graded more strictly.  However, the class size was a lot smaller than 140a, which made the course much more intimate and enjoyable.  Would highly recommend taking it if you're interested in continuing your acquisition of more formal grammar structures and vocab you wouldn't be able to learn on your own!  Also the course has a lot of selected excerpts from literature, plays, and poetry, which is a rewarding culmination of your work in Chinese class.  This primary source lens provides a great historical insight into the struggles, triumphs, and worries of Chinese people over many decades.","It is nothing unique from the 130 series. If you are looking to just learn more Chinese, it is just what you would expect. The vocabulary and grammar gets more and more obsolete as you go on, as may be expected. (It is much more work than 130)","This is a great class, consistent with earlier classes in the Chinese department, though steps up the intensity slightly. If you've taken Chinese here, you know what to expect. Interesting topics and well-taught.","A lot of work, but worth it","Take Chinese 140b - it's even better than 140a. Don't think twice; just take it!","A lot of what is taught in this class is perhaps academic beyond any real usefulness in casual conversation but nonetheless is good at teaching you how to speak Chinese."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"6.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"19","response rate":"94.74","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHNSE 140B","course_id":"770","cat_num":"119648","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHNSE 140b","course_id":"770","cat_num":"6844","1s":"0","2s":"8","3s":"10","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHNSE 140B","course_id":"770","cat_num":"119648","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
