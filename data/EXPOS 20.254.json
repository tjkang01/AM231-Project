The class in itself and the concepts we covered were not that interesting to me personally though.","The material taught in this course was very interesting. However, the essay writing was quite a difficult and arduous process.","Great class with a fantastic instructor.","Expos is a helpful class that will prepare you for writing other college papers.","I really liked the material taught in this course; overall, it was very valuable and well-taught, though difficult at times. It improved my writing skills and taught me a lot about how emotions are defined, how they influence our thinking, how to think about them, and how to form an analytical psychological argument.","It is much better than the other expos' from what I have gathered from other students.","Felt like this one was relatively difficult but ultimately more rewarding than other Expos classes.","As far as expos goes this is definitely one to consider. Expos as a course will never be life changing or awe inspiring. However from what I gather, this is one of the better ones. The work is manageable (fairly light on the reading, as it only requires reading journal articles), interesting (if you're in to psych), and professor tierney is incredibly wise and will really be able to help you with your writing. I highly recommend this class!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"6.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"14","response rate":"92.86","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.254","course_id":"12322","cat_num":"94868","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"9","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.254","course_id":"12322","cat_num":"94868","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
