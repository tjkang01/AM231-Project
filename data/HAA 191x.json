He is a great man and a very knowledgable resource. You can tell that he loves what he is talking about and it is infectious. This class was so interesting and really delves into the Encounter between the native peoples and the Spaniards on a level that is often ignored.","Fascinating material that Prof. Cummins deals with in a very sophisticated and thought-provoking way. And do the readings! They're really good and they help tie together all the big ideas he lectures about."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"4.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"12","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 191x","course_id":"12460","cat_num":"48085","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 191x","course_id":"12460","cat_num":"48085","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
