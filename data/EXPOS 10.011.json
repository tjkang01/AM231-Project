I came in with an okay style of writing but this class helped me hone some of my abilities.","It's truly helpful and beneficial. However, I kind of wished I had gone right to expos 20 so I wouldn't have to do two semesters.","If you are not sure about your writing abilities you should definitely take it. It is not hard or tough if you are willing to spare some time (3-4 hrs a week) to this class but on the other hand you learn a lot, seriously a lot, for that small amount of time.","The class is designed to cover every little detail about the process of writing. So if you feel confident about writing in general, the class might be little tedious.","It's a very easy course if you actually read the course material and write a thorough rough draft. The more work you put in to the course, the more you get out of it"]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Anyone who is not confident in their writing style should take Expos 10. Not only does Expos 10 give you confidence, it also really helps you have a solid foundation by assisting the transition from high school-level writing to college level.","Very helpful.","It's a great course and you learn a lot about writing.","Keep a positive attitude throughout!","The preceptor gave me great advice, and tried to think of many ways to improve my essays."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["There are numerous writing assignments, but only two major essays and you have time to edit every assignment","If you are not confident with writing, take this class. This is a perfect introduction for expos 20, as well as other classes' papers.","If you feel at all uncomfortable with your writing ability coming into college, just take this course.

I was on the fence about taking expos 10 or 20 and I'm so glad I decided to take 10. The progression of the course was so natural and I got feedback on every aspect of a final paper (through numerous response papers) which was super helpful when it came time to write the final paper. The work load isn't bad, not much reading, and everything we talk about is engaging even if you don't have an interest in art or education.","If you feel strongly that your writing is not strong, it's good to take because it definitely allows you to practice writing every component that goes into writing an essay.","If you are at all nervous about the essay-writing process or the fact that you'll have to write a great deal of essays in college and you don't feel ready, this course will give you all the tools and strategies that you need to prepare you for the rest of your college-essay writing experiences."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["If you get placed into expos 10, then definitely take it.
