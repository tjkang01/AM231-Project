Very fun and great to see all the research in the area being done on campus (very good if you are looking for a thesis lab in the field).","This course will not make you experts on infectious disease research but it will introduce you to the available facilities at Harvard. This was a very fun one-week course -- you will get to use fluorescent and electron microscopes, you will tour the microbiology lab of Boston Children's Hospital, you will be introduced to current researches by the faculty\/researchers in the ID field (and hopefully get to choose which lab you want to work at). I am not a DMS student but I really enjoyed it! Dr. Coleman is nice!
