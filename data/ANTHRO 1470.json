If you are interested in the subject matter presented in the syllabus, then of course you should take this class. It is certainly low stress, but note that you must take time to do the assignments well. Professor Rowlands is a fair grader, but he will be able to see when you didn't devote much time to a paper (and grade accordingly).","Since Dr. Rowlands was a visiting scholar, this course will probably not be offered again in the foreseeable future.  But if he is ever offered a position at Harvard (which he should be) I would highly recommend this course.  Dr. Rowlands put many of the faculty here to shame, because he actually cares about teaching and about undergraduates, answers emails punctually, and answers your questions thoroughly and with enthusiasm.  The course itself was a great fusion of social anthropology, archaeology, and history that gave me a great background on how anthropology has engaged with Aboriginal people and more broadly with indigenous peoples in the Victorian era.  The course readings for each week were wonderfully thought out; sometimes, Dr. Rowlands purposely included readings he thought were unconvincing or flawed, which encouraged us to read with very critical eyes and helped us see the differences between effective and ineffective argumentation.  I wish some of you reading this would be able to take this course!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"2.30","recommendation":"3.70","enrollment":"5","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 1470","course_id":"11341","cat_num":"96779","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 1470","course_id":"11341","cat_num":"96779","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 1470","course_id":"11341","cat_num":"96779","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
