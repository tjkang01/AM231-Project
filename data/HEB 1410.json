It really brings you to the cutting edge of microbiome research.","Wow this was an incredible class. The guy microbiome is amazing, but Prof. Carmody has such great explanations about everything. She's super enthusiastic and always willing to help or explain anything","The human micro biome is a fascinating topic that is emerging as a culprit in nearly all categories of human maladies. I highly, highly recommend taking this course and engaging with this emerging field! The week to week work is manageable (readings and two in class presentations), the laboratory sessions are fun, and Rachel is an amazing professor. I definitely recommend background in life sciences, human anatomy, and\/or human evolutionary biology: the assigned readings were challenging at times, even with this background. The students often choose the direction of our class discussions, and they are always interesting. My only criticism are the lack of guidelines for our final paper (worth 40% of our grade), and that the bioinformatics sessions could have been much more useful and productive. Overall, highly highly recommend if you have the background!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"5.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"8","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
