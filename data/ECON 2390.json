In our year, Michael Kremer was great, Prof. Townsend's lectures were good, but -- at least for me -- the remainder of the lectures was rather disappointing. Make sure you have covered enough of the prereqs","Good introduction to development economics","The course provides a good overview of the field, but it is a bit outdated.  If you are looking to have a good overview of the literature and baseline knowledge, this course is good for that.  But I think it is less good for learning about the direction of the field and thinking about future research topics."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.30","workload":"6.90","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"16","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 2390","course_id":"12792","cat_num":"156645","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"4","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 2390","course_id":"12792","cat_num":"156645","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
