Due to the lack of any homework for the class, we learned all the things that we did learn in class. Therefore class was very complicated and hard to follow at times (especially Woodin) while we learned relatively little.","This is a great freshman seminar! It's a fun, low-pressure way to investigate different branches of math.","If you like learning about and pondering the contours of advanced math in a relaxed setting from very distinguished people with a small, fun group, and pretty much no mandatory work, this class is for you.","Super interesting class"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"1.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"11","response rate":"72.73","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 23C","course_id":"13777","cat_num":"160198","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 23C","course_id":"13777","cat_num":"160198","1s":"5","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
