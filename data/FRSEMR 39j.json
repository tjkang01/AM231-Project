I would recommend taking this course if you like history and would like to attempt to study it through an environmental lens.","It's a very interesting class, but make sure to understand it is history based (not science like I thought it would be...) Be ready to read every week and to speak up in class (which is not a bad thing, it's actually quite fun)","It is an engaging and interesting seminar.","Nothing that hasn't been published.","This class is great for what it is - a seminar class that is graded sat\/unsat - and you will take out perhaps more than you put in. If you have a general idea what you are talking about in class, you will find the discussions really thought provoking. Susanna does a marvelous job of facilitating discussions and helping unearth what you think about important issues discussed. She is definitely a left-leaning (politically) teacher, so if that bothers you be forewarned. It's possible not to lean that way and learn wonderful things though (my case)! :) She is wonderfully passionate about what she believes in!","It focuses on the historical view of environment.\nIt'd be much easier\/less burdensome for you to read the materials over a couple days, but Susanna is still awesome no matter what.","Get ready, the class is great and the fieldtrip is fun!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"3.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"9","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 39j","course_id":"12373","cat_num":"35345","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"6","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 39j","course_id":"12373","cat_num":"35345","1s":"3","2s":"6","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
