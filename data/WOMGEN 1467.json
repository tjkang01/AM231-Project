She challenged us to think about the the interplay between text and images not only in class, but to see how these concepts interact with the world outside of the classroom.","This course was INCREDIBLE. Professor Brown is incredibly kind, an excellent facilitator, and she has so many interesting thoughts, sometimes it's just fun to listen to her talk about the work. If you like what you see on the syllabus (which, all of it is excellent, TAKE THIS CLASS!","this was a super interesting class! Prof Brown did a great job of both selecting texts\/visual art and of clustering it into thematic groups for each week. I really enjoyed the art component actually, because I've never looked at visual art before (other than some photography). would have strongly preferred getting more formalized direction for the final paper, because the professor kind of just said \"discuss a piece of visual art, and 17 pages\" in class, and I didn't realize until reading period that we needed to find multiple secondary sources also. but Prof Brown gave a lot of help for students in OH for the final paper, so it all worked out fine.","Great class! Fascinating reading and photographs to fuel great discussions. K.J. Brown is an enthusiastic instructor who cares about her students."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"4.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"14","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
