Though the first term is far more valuable for learning how to read late imperial administrative documents than the second term, the second term is still extremely useful as a place to put the skills you've learned into practice in your own work."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"3.80","difficulty":"4.40","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHNSHIS 270b","course_id":"794","cat_num":"84929","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHNSHIS 270b","course_id":"794","cat_num":"84929","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHNSHIS 270b","course_id":"794","cat_num":"84929","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
