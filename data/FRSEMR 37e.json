This seminar does have more papers assigned than others but the topics are interesting.","this was a very interesting class, and i took it because i thought the topic sounded great, and fun to study. however, i was completely unprepared for how much work this class would require (especially compared to other freshman seminars which require very little work). the professor was knowledgable and i really liked her, but just know that you will have to spend a lot of time on this course.","Loved this seminar. It was definitely worth taking.","great course for english loving students"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"2.40","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 37e","course_id":"1843","cat_num":"64421","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 37e","course_id":"1843","cat_num":"64421","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 37e","course_id":"1843","cat_num":"64421","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
