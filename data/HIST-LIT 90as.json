It was the first year running when I took it, so there were a couple of hiccups (like late updates to the week's readings, or readings on reserve and not online, etc.) but these didn't detract from the overall phenomenal nature of the materials and regions that were put into context within a discussion of the French colonial and post-colonial Empire. If you're interested in France, literature, or colonial\/post-colonial things at all, I highly recommend at least shopping this course because it was really one that changed the way I think about primary sources. It also opened my eyes to a whole lot of other kinds of materials in terms of content (all over the French Empire) and form (movies, songs, books, novels, plays, you name it..).","This class is fantastic, but make sure you keep up with the work. It is easy to fall behind."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90as","course_id":"2530","cat_num":"16317","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90as","course_id":"2530","cat_num":"16317","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90as","course_id":"2530","cat_num":"16317","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
