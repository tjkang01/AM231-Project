However, the class research paper can be incredibly stressful if you have no experience writing one.","Katz is a baller. You should get to know him.","There is a lot of material to cover, but it's worth it.","You must be interested in the material AND the approach. You also need to be on top of doing the paper in an organized and graduaal way thru the term.","Take this course if you want a general overview of how economists have thought about some of the biggest social problems in USA. I would not take this course if you really want to learn something about how to think about a social problem, its policies and solutions.","This course is a great course if you want to understand the basics of these important social issues and what the research says about them. It is also a wonderful way to read some of the best research in the field that has been completed using rigorous methods.","Social Analysis 10 is not necessarily the only course you need to do well in this class. Must have had taken some other advance economics courses as well. Class is not very difficult, but the class is very dense in information.","This is a great course to take if you are interested in social policy making and an economic point of view. It would also be great for Juniors who are looking for an idea for a thesis in Economics.","This class is interesting because it allows you to look at social problems from a statistical perspective.","The professor is really enthusiastic, and the course gives a good surface-level understanding of our economy.","This course is an excellent, sometimes surprising explanation of the economics of American social problems and their solutions. If you want to know how (and how well) welfare, public schools, and prisons work in, empirical, economic terms, this is the class for you."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.52","workload":"1.58","difficulty":"2.91","recommendation":"3.56","enrollment":"37","response rate":"89.19","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 1815","course_id":"1004","cat_num":"3130","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"11","4s":"11","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 1815","course_id":"1004","cat_num":"3130","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"24","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 1815","course_id":"1004","cat_num":"3130","1s":"17","2s":"13","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
