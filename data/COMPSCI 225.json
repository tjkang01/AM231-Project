Pseudorandomness is right on the thematic border between mathematics and computer science, so it's perfect for those interested in both. Salil is a fantastic lecturer, and the textbook (which started out as lecture notes for this class some years ago) is one of the best written textbooks I have ever read.\r\n\r\nHowever, this class is also very difficult and is a major time commitment, so make sure you have the time to devote to it. If you do, it will be an incredibly rewarding experience.","This class is awesome!","The material is excellent, and Salil delivers it well, but be warned -- the course, at least in Spring 2015, was in a format which required in-class and online participation for every class -- this kind of isn't a course to take if you're fond of missing lecture.","good class. Salil rocks. You should attend class more than I did though :o #10amsad","If you are into Complexity Theory you should definitely get this course. Even if you are not, you might learn cool things about expanders, extractors, codes and pseudorandom generatos that might be helpful to your research somehow."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"13.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"13","response rate":"92.31","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
