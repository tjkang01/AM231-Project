You really gain a new perspective of science throughout history and its interactions with politics and society. I took this class as a non-Social Studies concentrator and still found the readings and discussions engaging. There are about 4-5 readings every week along with weekly responses -- fairly manageable. There is one research essay on a topic of your choice, which I found enjoyable to write. Prof. Jewett leads great discussions and also provides good feedback on essays."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["The material is very theoretical, but Professor Jewett wants to help you to understand it. Definitely get to know him and ask him clarifying questions. It will likely be a small tutorial, as it has been the past few times.","An amazing seminar analyzing the role of science in society here in America.  Goes across a number of key issues and draws themes between them all.  Not too much reading and one can take a lot away from it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"5.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOC-STD 98AB","course_id":"12621","cat_num":"156243","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOC-STD 98AB","course_id":"12621","cat_num":"156243","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
