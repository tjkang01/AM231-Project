The class is VERY interesting and you learn a lot about a wide array of topics from Middle Eastern Languages to Classic American Literature.","It's a lot of fun, and you'll learn at least as much about the world as you will about Lovecraft.","Come in with an open mind, ready to listen and learn from a great mind with years and years of experience and passionate knowledge. Dr. Russell is an incredible person and a great teacher on this [wide range of] subjects.","If you are looking at this class, take it. Prof. Russell is an incredible instructor. You will learn a lot about things that you never even imagined existed, and you will come out really having better understood our mythological narratives and how lore is constructed.","Most of the charm of the class comes from the teacher, and there is a chance that Professor Russell's personality will rub you the wrong way, so if there is something about him that you don't like, it won't be a pleasant experience. I personally loved the class, and Professor Russell was easily my favorite teacher this semester, but the same eccentricities that I found endearing someone else might find off-putting. But the main reasons I enjoyed this class, more than the amazing course content and material and discussion, was because Professor Russell was such an amazing teacher and such an amazing person. He has such interesting and fascinating stories to share, and I could tell that he truly cares for his students and enjoyed the class as much as we did."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"11","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 34D","course_id":"13110","cat_num":"160202","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 34D","course_id":"13110","cat_num":"160202","1s":"4","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
