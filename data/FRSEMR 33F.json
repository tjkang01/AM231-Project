If you truly want to dip your feet into metaphysics this is definitely the course to take.","This class is a great introduction to philosophy and the skills learned through mapping can be applied to many other fields.","This is a great class! Very helpful for transitioning to college as it isn't too much work, but involves an intimate setting with multiple professors, who are enthusiastic and engaging.","It is a very good introductory class to philosophy. There are no philosophy papers but there is a lot of discussion about the philosophical ideas presented in the readings. The class will also improve your ability to analyze arguments and formulate your own opinion."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"8","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 33F","course_id":"13205","cat_num":"159904","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 33F","course_id":"13205","cat_num":"159904","1s":"4","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
