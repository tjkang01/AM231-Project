Without any doubt, this is the best planned course I have taken at Harvard. Besides the extraordinarily packed and enjoyable trips to New York (where MoMA brought out Picasso's two guitars JUST FOR US!) and Philadelphia\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u201cwhich, I am afraid, might not be available for the future editions of the course\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u201cthe course reading is very carefully tailored to introduce you to important issues in Cubism, as well as, different interpretations and approaches to it throughout the last 100 years. Prof. Gough's a phenomenal teacher (with a great sense of humor!), who makes sure that everybody is on the same page by always defining key terms and specific art-historical vocabulary. Her emphasis on methodology was particularly useful for someone like me, who loves finding out how people arrive at the conclusions they derive, and why they write it down the way they do.","In this class you will look closely at works of art, put real pressure on some of the readings, and the professor is great at leading discussion.  You might even get to go on a field trip or two.  Take it!","We spent two weekends away on field trips, and a week doing presentations. In addition to the readings, the class is very time consuming."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"3.30","difficulty":"3.90","recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"12","response rate":"91.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 272v","course_id":"10983","cat_num":"94163","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 272v","course_id":"10983","cat_num":"94163","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"8","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 272v","course_id":"10983","cat_num":"94163","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"5","4s":"3","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
