Lab sections rarely end on time and students are expected to come in on their own to finish any incomplete work","Great class to take if you want to learn more about experimental design. Professor De Bivort is very helpful and he really is very good at experimental design.","Great for lab experience. Also very supportive environment. I was taking OEB 57 at the same time and got to apply the concepts through creating experiments.","This class is pretty awesome. Maude was the best TF ever. The professor is super engaging and fun. This class will make you into a man. Definitely take if you want to learn more about experimental design. It helps you think about how to test a hypothesis successfully."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["Due to the small size of the class this year, the Ben and James decided to turn the class into a mini-lab, so much of this information may or may not be useful in future renditions of the class. \r\n\r\nDue to this switch, the class ended up being quite a time commitment. We did behavioral experiments with cockroaches and submitted a paper for publication. We were in class 7 hours a week, and had to come in outside of class to run experiments. On top of the time spent in the class (lab), we had to do a comprehensive lit review and produce a paper. It was hectic, but I learned more about science, the scientific process, and what it takes to do research in this class than in any class I've taken. I'm actually confident to say that I learned more in this class than I did in any class bar none. Very rewarding experience."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"10.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"OEB 131","course_id":"11071","cat_num":"130661","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"OEB 131","course_id":"11071","cat_num":"31902","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"OEB 131","course_id":"11071","cat_num":"130661","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
