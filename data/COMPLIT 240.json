Prof KZY is so much fun to talk to and always has a smart and articulate take on the material, and the discussion was always enjoyable. The class was very personal and nurturing; every meeting was more like a good conversation than a class. I always looked forward to it even though it was on a Friday afternoon. Take it if you're interested in the syllabus!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPLIT 240","course_id":"551","cat_num":"86364","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPLIT 240","course_id":"551","cat_num":"86364","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPLIT 240","course_id":"551","cat_num":"86364","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
