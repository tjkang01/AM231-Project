The workload is one 10-page paper with a performance, or one 20-page paper, for the whole semester. However, it's the culmination of a semester's worth of research, and is only worthwhile if research is done consistently.","The perfect way to study aspects of performance practice that you have always been curious about and never had the chance to investigate.","You have to take a class with Prof. Levin if you like music. You will learn more from him than any other person in the world."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"1.40","difficulty":"2.20","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MUSIC 182r","course_id":"3648","cat_num":"1460","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MUSIC 182r","course_id":"3648","cat_num":"1460","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MUSIC 182r","course_id":"3648","cat_num":"1460","1s":"3","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
