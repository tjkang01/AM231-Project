Although students lecture in the class, Steven Caton's views throughout are critical and helps one detangle a rather complicated subject. Both parts of the class were amazing, the first which explores the framework was interesting, and the application in the second part is also amazing.  This was undoubtedly one the best classes I took at Harvard by a very critical, and humble thinker.","Provides essential theoretical knowledge. The readings are stimulating, and the Professor is fantastic and always available to students. He also made many of the concepts I was struggling with clear in his explanations.","You will learn a lot in this class. Great materials and great professor. Steve really makes this course and would be very helpful for you to understand about about the Frankfurt School's extraordinary project and how it is relevant to our contemporary problem with human rights, politics and popular culture.","This course is really amazing--be prepared for some serious reading work, but be prepared to work with a really great professor who is not afraid to be challenged and have really frank discussions about politics and theory, and to have great conversations with other students, all of whom seem really excited about this course and were drawn to it for vastly differing reasons, which made the course all the more rich and nuanced."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"9.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"12","response rate":"91.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 2688","course_id":"217","cat_num":"1182","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 2688","course_id":"217","cat_num":"1182","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 2688","course_id":"217","cat_num":"1182","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
