I also feel that much of your success will depend on your relationship with your advisor. It helps to work with someone with whom you feel comfortable and you know will support you. Luckily, I'm very close with my advisor and she's taught me so much. Try to find someone who you can build a relationship with because having a reliable support system will make your experience a million times more fruitful.","Take this and just do research in a lab. It's tougher when doing a thesis for your research but still pretty manageable"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This is your opportunity to explore!","This class is amazing because it allows you to pursue any research you can find that interests you.","This \"class\" (guided research) is a great way to do something fascinating with research and get academic credit for doing it. A lot of times we want to or are even \"supposed to\" do research, but it can be scary since it's basically adding another class that you're not immediately getting credit for. The 91r classes are great because you get to have that life experience while getting academic credit for it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.86","workload":"3.14","difficulty":"2.71","recommendation":"4.86","enrollment":"10","response rate":"70.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"BE 91r","course_id":"1216","cat_num":"63962","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"BE 91r","course_id":"1216","cat_num":"63962","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"BE 91r","course_id":"1216","cat_num":"63962","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"3","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
