I think the idea of exploring film as a means of understanding how modernity has redefined our understanding of space (especially through architecture) is a fascinating endeavor and one that can plausibly encompass a variety of disciplines, from philosophy, literature to architecture and painting.","A great, lowkey introduction to film studies and theory -- you get to see a bunch fun films and talk about them with a diverse group.","It really made me more open-minded and eager to appreciate architecture."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Excellent syllabus, films, and readings, somewhat disappointing classroom experience, total lack of interaction with the professor.","One of the best lecture experiences you will ever have."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 180","course_id":"5228","cat_num":"2874","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 180","course_id":"5228","cat_num":"2874","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 180","course_id":"5228","cat_num":"2874","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
