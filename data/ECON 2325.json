'11":{"comments":["This is a really great class to take if you're interested in development issues. The field of economics is seemingly just starting to catch on to the idea that \"history matters,\" and this is an excellent way to get introduced to the literature in this field. Professor Nunn is wonderful. It's a non-overwhelming amount of reading each week, and the assignments are really helpful for grad students (the main deliverable is the student's own research project).","Try to think early on about your term paper. The course requires a fair amount of work but gives you great experience of discussing papers and provides plenty of research ideas.","Definitely take this class! It offers a rare opportunity to study a field early in its development with one of its leading founders. I've never had a class help me generate so many new research questions and strategies for answering them."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["A great course to learn about the economic history of development","That they must take it if they are interested in development, and that James Robinson and Nathan Nunn are very cool and great teachers.  I was previously not particularly interested in economic history -- I had never taken a course on it before -- but this course changed my view completely.  I would even go as far as to say that one of my subliminal default responses to a development problem is now to question what the historical origins of it are.  The course is a fair amount of work, but very interesting work."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Be prepared to devote a couple of nights a week to read and write for this course, plus needing to come up with a feasible research idea."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"7.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"13","response rate":"61.54","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 2325","course_id":"1042","cat_num":"126819","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 2325","course_id":"1042","cat_num":"8510","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 2325","course_id":"1042","cat_num":"126819","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
