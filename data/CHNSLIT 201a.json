The final test provides a major motivation for learning the content of the lecture notes, though.","The exam is difficult, but the course is a must for anyone interested in pursuing a doctorate in Chinese literature.","The format of the class is: you read the lecture notes and submit questions. Class time is devoted to answering the questions.","This course provides you with great background knowledge and overview of the entire field of Chinese literary history. It is a great introductory course that will change your thinking about Chinese history and literature.","It's a basic class for Classical Chinese literature, so if students decide to take it, it's better to take it sooner than later"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.12","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.62","recommendation":"4.25","enrollment":"9","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHNSLIT 201a","course_id":"799","cat_num":"0165","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHNSLIT 201a","course_id":"799","cat_num":"0165","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHNSLIT 201a","course_id":"799","cat_num":"0165","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
