If you appreciate beautiful language and deep, though-provoking analysis, there is a lot for you to love here.","You have to be a big, big fan of poetry, practically a nerd, because lectures will be very dull to you otherwise since they're fairly abstract and harder than something like an introductory poetry class. That being said, I'm a total poetry nerd so it was great for me!","Again, I strongly recommend this course\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u201c but not if you are the kind of student who likes to focus on one author, or one historical period, etc. at a time.","You really need to enjoy poetry!","Professor Johnson is very knowledge, and brings up great points about the poets and poems.  I would have preferred a little bit more discussion in section."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"2.70","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"11","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LITER 106","course_id":"597","cat_num":"6351","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"6","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LITER 106","course_id":"597","cat_num":"6351","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LITER 106","course_id":"597","cat_num":"6351","1s":"1","2s":"8","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
