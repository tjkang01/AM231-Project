I didn't think I \"liked\" poetry or older-French writing before taking this class, but it really helped me gain a better understanding of the French literary trajectory and learn more about the history, culture, music, etc. of the late Middle Ages\/the Renaissance.","This course is phenomenal--Virginie Greene is a fantastic professor and is so knowledgeable and proficient in the topic of medieval poetry, and encourages discussion and interpretation wonderfully. It was great balance between big ideas of themes, styles, musicality, and contextualization, and close-reading of texts. You will need a good reading knowledge of French--most texts are all in French and are extensive, but there was still a variety of French experience in the course. If you have any interest in poetry, music, French, the Middle Ages, manuscripts, etc., take this course!!!","This was a great class! It's a great tour of French poetry, a lot of the poems are very beautiful. Professor Greene does a great job providing background information, leading discussion, and explaining difficult questions. Minimal homework load, flexible essay assignments.","This was definitely an enjoyable course. Poetry is not easy in English, and old French is not going to be any easier but the modern translations help you so much with your reading comprehension, seeing the evolution of this beautiful language through poetry. The small class size helped ease discussion, and Professor Greene is very passionate about the course.","Just take any course with Virginie Greene and your life will be amazing."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRENCH 112","course_id":"13951","cat_num":"119220","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRENCH 112","course_id":"13951","cat_num":"119220","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
