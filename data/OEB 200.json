It's run entirely in discussion format, which is a really great way to learn and think about the material, and it's also more fun than listening to lecture and doing homework assignments. You get to learn a lot from the other students as well as the professor.","This course is very interesting and Mansi is a very knowledgable professor. However, the course is loosely structured, so only very self-motivated students should take this class.","You're going to learn a lot. And learn how to discuss various topics and techniques in depth."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"3.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"9","response rate":"44.44","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
