The assignments are challenging, but well worth the effort.  The readings are quite accessible, as are the lectures and discussions."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["It's a great introduction to an important area within economics.","one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard - excellent balance of theory and current policy relevance; psets are very useful, and lectures are extremely interesting and engaging"]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["This is the best course I've taken at Harvard so far. If you are interested in health economics this class shouldn't just be a consideration but a \"must take\" (if the course title didn't already signal that).  You cover a lot of material in some detail and the course really helps to generate ideas for your own research. Finally the small class size and professor Cutler's teaching style make the class very interactive and fun.","You will get the most out of this class if you've got a solid econ foundation. It's heavily focused on US healthcare, but lessons (especially ways of thinking about problems and research questions) apply to other areas in health too.","Terrific course you will get a lot out of. Just be sure to do the reading and be ready to talk.","Without a doubt the best course I've taken at Harvard.","Great, well-taught class covering a range of topics in the economics of health and medical care"]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["Fantastic course. You should take it.","Terrific class, particularly if you're interested in US health policy.  Definitely good to have some micro econ under your belt, as well as econometrics of some sort (not necessarily econ department econometrics).  The homeworks and readings were definitely work but I didn't feel like it was an overwhelming amount of work.  I really learned a lot and overall great class.","Terrific, engaging professor and a good set of readings."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["The latter half of the course focuses on the US health care system (larger than the U.K. economy!) and requires a certain familiarity with its institutional details. This can be somewhat overwhelming for those without a health background, but this knowledge is essential for full understanding and appreciation of these topics.","This is a really beneficial and enjoyable class. If you are at all interested in health econ, I would strongly recommend you take it.","If you are interested in researching health care policy or health economics, take this course. Cutler is a fantastic lecturer and discussion leader, and it is a fun group of students to meet."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"7.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"11","response rate":"63.64","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 2465","course_id":"1063","cat_num":"126074","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 2465","course_id":"1063","cat_num":"83396","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 2465","course_id":"1063","cat_num":"126074","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
