It was much more philosophically and theory oriented than I expected, with not as much discussion about policy. However, it was still fascinating. If you're interested in both democratic theory and the role science plays in democracy, this would be a good seminar to take.","This a relaxed class with some interesting material. If you're coming to it from a hard science background, however, you'll likely find a lot of the reading annoying, in the sense that it seems to misunderstand science. There is very little on the reading list actually authored by a scientist, and some that is only indirectly related to the governance of science. Nonetheless, for those interested in the governance of science, this class is a relatively painless way to become acquainted with this body of literature. Also there is a lot of freedom on the final paper, which makes it (potentially) quite fun.","Landauer is great and very nice. This isn't an easy class by any means - you will leave section scratching your head wondering what you just talked about for two hours. But a really interesting and broad subject that gives you the freedom to pursue a gamut of ideas for your final project."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.30","recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 94ul","course_id":"10886","cat_num":"85383","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 94ul","course_id":"10886","cat_num":"85383","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 94ul","course_id":"10886","cat_num":"85383","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
