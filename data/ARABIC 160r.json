He is a living Encyclopedia of Islamic Civilization.","To get the most from this class, make sure to find out what sections of texts will be read and translate as much as you can. Hava dictionary is quite a useful one to consult, but ask around\/fellow students for others including online ones. Self-motivation and outside work will really provide you with the most benefits for this class. Professor Mottahedeh is a wealth of knowledge so knowing the right questions to ask based on some familiarity, or at least superficial research into Islamic historiographers, biographers, and geographers will be very beneficial. Do as much as you can outside of class to really fine-tune and perfect skills outside of class and in office hours.","Make sure to prepare adequately and read the texts in advance: that will help make the class more productive. Also because Prof. Mottahedeh is remarkably humble and modest, you should ask a lot of questions, because that is the best way to benefit from his immense knowledge!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.43","workload":"1.67","difficulty":"2.83","recommendation":"4.71","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ARABIC 160r","course_id":"3750","cat_num":"5617","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ARABIC 160r","course_id":"3750","cat_num":"5617","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ARABIC 160r","course_id":"3750","cat_num":"5617","1s":"2","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
