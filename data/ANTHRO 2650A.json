If Dr. Matory is teaching you are in luck for a engaging review but BE PREPARED TO WORK!!","The seminar provides a panoramic view of the main problems and theoretical positions of the discipline of anthropology during the 19th and part of the 20th century.","The workload is heavy, but it is definitely worth the effort.

The course also helped me to think more critically about the problematic nature of anthropological research, and will undoubtedly inform my future projects, and ultimately challenge me to take more risks and think more creatively about my potential path as a scholar.","Challenging but really valuable.","Don't beat yourself up about reading every page.

Also, allowing a certain amount of triage in the reading is not only understandable but probably expected. The important thing is to read as much as possible but not to sacrifice too much of  depth of engagement with the texts for the sake of reading all of them.","This course is about reading thoroughly and participating regularly as you build intellectual community with your doctoral cohort. You may want to create a reading list of classics in social theory to supplement proseminar as its content varies and no one will force you to read Weber, Durkheim etc in bulk.","A course that is unpredictable but that will take you to incredible places!"]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Push faculty to change this course and make it a more serious engagement with the history of anthropology and contemporary social theory. Other places are offering far more rigorous and useful proseminars to their graduate students, and this course is not enough for us.","This course requires lots of time and work but worth taking it if interested in the history of anthropology.","This course will largely increase one's understanding of anthropology. And the readings and discussion in class is very inspiring for one's research."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Try to construct a genealogy or press Mary to make the connections more explicit (when asked questions, her answers were very helpful).","Its a requirement, and you don't have a choice but to take it. However, I enjoyed every bit of the class. The professor deeply engaged with the materials, challenged the class to think broadly about concepts, and anchored class discussions in a very lively way.
