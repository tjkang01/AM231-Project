If you plan to do quant research in the social sciences and want to move beyond linear regression, this is one of the best courses you can take!","Great course that offers plenty of opportunities to be creative and work on a variety of things. The course itself is not difficult. However, the content covered is not at all easy. Although the course offers a short crash course in linear algebra, the mathematical background necessary to actually understand these methods is not fully covered. Though not necessary, I would recommend linear algebra (as a class or youtube videos online) before enrolling.","You should take it!","Perhaps the best part of this class is that the major assignments will be to use what you learn in the class to do analyses on your own data. None of the time you spend on this class will be time wasted."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"5.90","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"23","response rate":"78.26","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
