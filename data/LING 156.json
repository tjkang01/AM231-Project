Not only did this course change what I knew about Bantu languages but also changed the way I view language in general. Also, Professor Van der Wal was one of the sweetest, most enthusiastic, and most supportive professors I have ever had.","An amazing class that really gets across how important crosslinguistic work is in testing theories that have been largely developed around Western European languages."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"4.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"7","response rate":"57.14","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
