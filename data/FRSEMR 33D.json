Was expecting it to be *about* drawing (history, conceptual borders, etc.) but it turned out to be mostly a studio class, which was nice. I meant for it to be my \"buffer class\", the one I could ignore when classes got intense, but it's really hard to make yourself walk away from a drawing before it's good enough! \r\n\r\nKatarina Burin and Melissa Krok-Horton are great teachers; they'll give you as much guidance or space as you need. Good class to take if you want to take an occasional afternoon or all-nighter off from other studies to make a big cool picture. Could also lead into additional serious VES coursework.","If you want a drawing class that will let you exercise your artistic freedom and foster your current skill set, this is the class.","Pass\/fail art class! You literally can do nothing wrong here.","You learn so much and it a good way to have some planned de stress time","This class is a lot less about drawing and more about the ideas and implications of certain subject matters in drawings. Thats something to be aware of before you take this.","I would tell students enrolling in this course to be prepared for a considerable amount of preparation that goes into each class, and for a consistent amount of weekly work that can be somewhat time-consuming.","You will get a lot out of this course if you are emotionally invested in your pieces--it shows if you are putting energy into them"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"5.90","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"11","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 33D","course_id":"13061","cat_num":"159886","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 33D","course_id":"13061","cat_num":"159886","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
