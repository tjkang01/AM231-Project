Professor Hooley is amazing, the workload is very manageable, and the major assignment is fun, interesting, and refreshingly different.","Professor Hooley is great, the weekly expectations are manageable, the material is interesting. A great class for those interested in clinical psych.","If you want to learn more about Cognitive-Behavior therapy approach in clinical psychology rather than other approaches(e.g. Psychodynamic,Existential,and etc), this course is wonderful.","This is one of the best classes I have ever taken at Harvard. In my opinion, it is the best class the psychology department has for those interested in becoming practicing clinicians."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["amazing class, amazing prof, unlike any other psych seminar","This is an amazing class!","Take this if there is something about yourself that you want to change. It is great for that. You have to be willing to share with others, but the environment is very friendly and supportive. You'll also learn a lot about being a clinician. This class is more applied, which is great, since Harvard tends to be so theoretical.","If you are interested in entering the clinical field or really enjoyed taking abnormal psychology and other abnormal classes, then you will really enjoy this class.","This was a great class. I learned so much and Professor Hooley was great. If you are interested at all in clinical psych, definitely take this class. It is only difficult because you get to actually act as your own therapist, which is not an easy undertaking. (Although I have no idea what my grade is going to be, because there aren't really graded assignments until the very end.)"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.86","workload":"2.07","difficulty":"2.71","recommendation":"4.79","enrollment":"14","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 1851","course_id":"4289","cat_num":"6392","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"12"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 1851","course_id":"4289","cat_num":"6392","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"11","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 1851","course_id":"4289","cat_num":"6392","1s":"2","2s":"9","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
