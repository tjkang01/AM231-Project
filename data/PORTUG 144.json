I enjoyed learning about the history of the world (and its dominant\/reactionary waves of thought), but I sometimes thought we could have focused a lot more on participating and contributing as a class to our interpretations of the work.","This class was a bit disorganized and I wasn't always sure of where we were going. The final paper presented a chance to really research and write about something from the course that I found interesting, and that aspect of the class was really great."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.62","workload":"1.75","difficulty":"2.75","recommendation":"3.75","enrollment":"9","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PORTUG 144","course_id":"4455","cat_num":"11776","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PORTUG 144","course_id":"4455","cat_num":"11776","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PORTUG 144","course_id":"4455","cat_num":"11776","1s":"3","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
