The professor is also incredible.","If you do service and you want to think more critically about service, take this class. If you want to think more deeply about how Harvard prepares students to be world citizens, take this class. If you want to connect your extra curricular and academic life in a way that enhances both, take this class. Just take this class","definitely must take if you are even remotely interested in public service.","Having faculty interested in students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 community service pursuits is a blessing and, unfortunately, is a rare opportunity at Harvard. This class does a great job of tracing  the development of Harvard's civic mission and analyzing the  social theory that goes into creating an effective community development project. Service and impactful scholarship are clearly passions of the professor. The conversations are interesting, applicable, and inspirational since all students have done service and are interested in doing that work better. This is my favorite class taken this semester. There is a lot of reading, but easier assignments.","This class is very good. The readings and topics discussed are very interesting.","This is a great class, that really pushes you to think about how service works, at Harvard, and in general. This is a great find, especially for students who are at least minimally-involved at PBHA, and want to be more involved or think critically about the scholarship behind higher-ed community-based programs.","This is a fantastic course. If you're passionate about public service and interested in the historical and theoretical background of service work, this is the class for you."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"5.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"8","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOC-STD 68EC","course_id":"13059","cat_num":"159823","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOC-STD 68EC","course_id":"13059","cat_num":"159823","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
