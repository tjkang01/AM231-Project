It helps to have a solid math foundation.","Ec 1070 was a great course! Excellent introduction to economics concepts for mathematically inclined students. Jerry Green is wonderful, and Katie was a helpful TF. Great way to get to know a professor better in a small setting, I wish I had taken it as a junior and used the course to develop a thesis topic.","This class was not very time consuming at all, but the material is very abstract and difficult to understand. This course seems targeted towards pure math students who happen to have an interest in economics, and not the other way around.","If you're interested in mathematics and want to try an interesting application of mathematics to an interesting field, I would definitely take it. The class doesn't require a lot of work and you'll learn some very interesting stuff. The course staff care a lot and are very nice."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.78","workload":"2.44","difficulty":"3.56","recommendation":"4.75","enrollment":"9","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 1070","course_id":"967","cat_num":"5972","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 1070","course_id":"967","cat_num":"5972","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"6","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 1070","course_id":"967","cat_num":"5972","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
