The guest speakers were great. Zittrain and Lessig together have an amazing dynamic. I strongly recommend this class.","This class is amazing if you are interested in the non-technical implications of technologies and the subtle interactions between their creators.  I highly recommend it, especially if you have a very strong programming background.  Although the course obviously has no coding component, if you come from a technical background, you'll find the class' perspectives refreshing and very different than most CS classes that deal with the same topics on similar grounds.","Digital platforms was an excellent class!  The professors took a tremendous amount of time to make the class and all of the lectures very interesting.  The readings were also very interesting, and getting to give a presentation to the class was a great way to practice the skills I learned in the class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"2.60","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPSCI 2","course_id":"11402","cat_num":"31335","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPSCI 2","course_id":"11402","cat_num":"31335","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPSCI 2","course_id":"11402","cat_num":"31335","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
