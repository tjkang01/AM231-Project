This class examines the general procedure for building models of such coupled processes, and even if you do not develop new theory, will be invaluable for understanding the structure and limitations of models available int he literature.","This course is excellent lectured by Prof.Zhigang Suo. The professor is extremely enthusiastic and engaged. The instructor's broad experience in solid mechanics would help to sharp student's background in basic thermal dynamics and finite deformation of solids."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This is a really good course which teaches you the fundamentals of the mechanics of soft materials and also an opportunity to learn from an excellent teacher (Prof.Suo)","This course is useful. I like the teaching style of the instructor. He is very funny.","The professor is very entertaining, and you should definitely read the notes and do the exercises to get the most possible out of the course.","Assuming the grading style isn't going to change, the course doesn't *require* much out of you.  It depends primarily on how motivated you are on learning the material.","Little burden","It's very important, especially if one hasn't taken a similar course, to spend time outside of class thinking about the lectures. It's all too easy to fool yourself into thinking you understand the nuances of a topic. The exercises provide a good self-test."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["The instructor likes to interact with students. He may be very opinionated at times but that's his nature and he means no disrespect to any students.","Great course and great teacher.","Great class for people who are interested in solid mechanics."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.67","workload":"2.67","difficulty":"3.17","recommendation":"4.67","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENG-SCI 241","course_id":"1374","cat_num":"6711","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENG-SCI 241","course_id":"1374","cat_num":"6711","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENG-SCI 241","course_id":"1374","cat_num":"6711","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
