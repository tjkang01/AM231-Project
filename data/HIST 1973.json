I learned so much about different historical approaches and found areas of study that I didn't even know existed before. Tracy is great and overall it was a wonderful class.","Tracy was amazing - such a wonderful experience to take a course with a visiting professor.  It was a treat to take such a small seminar style class.  I feel like I really came away with a deeper appreciation for history as a discipline.  I feel much more well rounded!  And I liked the way this course helped me think about the past as a social construction (it makes sense now)!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1973","course_id":"13239","cat_num":"159878","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1973","course_id":"13239","cat_num":"159878","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
