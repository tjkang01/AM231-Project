All in all a wonderful class! Readings were great, assignments were actually enjoyable, class discussions were always fun, and instructor was wonderful: very helpful and just a genuinely great person. I would definitely recommend taking this class, or anything else Marina teaches!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"7","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 90bc","course_id":"12297","cat_num":"10289","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 90bc","course_id":"12297","cat_num":"10289","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
