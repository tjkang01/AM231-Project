It brings together a lot of different ideas, so if you come into this course with set expectations, you'll probably be disappointed. The work also doesn't really facilitate bonding time with other students or the professor. Overall it's not bad for a freshman seminar, it's low stress, low work, and low commitment. If you keep an open mind and you enjoy reading, you'll probably have a good time.","This freshman seminar was really fantastic! The readings are all super interesting, and Professor Kim is incredibly nice and great at facilitating discussions.","This seminar is interesting and relaxed. It doesn't go heavily into literary analysis but covers more discussions about themes.","If the description of the course and the reading list sound interesting to you, it will not disappoint. This is a really cool class and Dr. Kim is very approachable"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 30D","course_id":"13050","cat_num":"159721","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 30D","course_id":"13050","cat_num":"159721","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
