It's a whole new prism through which to view American history. Lectures were old-fashioned- no power points, just talking- but it was always engaging. Professor Hall is basically the world expert on Puritan culture, so learning from him felt like an honor. I hope this course is taught again soon for everyone to experience!","I'm not sure if Hall will be teaching this again but I think it's a really important class if you're interested in American religion or want to understand American religious culture which so heavily influences politics.","Great course.  But what made it for me was Professor Hall, who probably won't be teaching it again.","Hall is great but apparently it's his last year!","This class is an amazing window onto a period of time that would be very hard to access otherwise. Early American religion is incredibly important to the current structure of our society, and this class provides an excellent understanding of that period and its thought. Equal parts history, theology, and intellectual history, this class is incredibly valuable."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.31","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"2.54","recommendation":"4.08","enrollment":"17","response rate":"76.47","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 1468","course_id":"5072","cat_num":"2509","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RELIGION 1468","course_id":"5072","cat_num":"2509","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 1468","course_id":"5072","cat_num":"2509","1s":"2","2s":"10","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
