He also brings in really good cookies every week, which is a plus. The only downside is the same downside of any seminar class, the experience is only as good as the students in the section.","As a freshman seminar it's a great fourth class to take on a tough workload. The final project is what it all builds up too, but the project itself isn't too demanding even. The only criticism I have for the class is the time but it's necessary. Take it.","Don't take this class unless you're actually interested in astrophysics. I took the course hoping it would be a relaxing class where I'd get to look into space with the telescopes and it ended up being a lot of really dull math.","This course was great to take as a humanities concentrator who would not invest in taking a very serious astrophysics or astronomy class but is still very curious about those topics."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"1.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"10","response rate":"70.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 23R","course_id":"13972","cat_num":"161261","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 23R","course_id":"13972","cat_num":"161261","1s":"3","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
