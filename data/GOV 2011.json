If the student is not ready to work on his or her own survey, they he or she will not get as much out of the course and another course might be more appropriate.","If you are serious about conducting a survey, take this class.  If you are just vaguely curious about surveys, read a book about them and then enroll in this class later when you are ready to move forward with your survey."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["Anyone who wants to familiarize themselves with survey research through constructing a survey MUST take this course. It is a low pressure, collaborative environment where you work with Chase and your peers to improve and interrogate your survey."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["You will need to be very proactive in order to get feedback on your work. The class is most helpful for students who are planning to implement a project imminently. Though it is a survey research course, Chase is also very knowledgeable on qualitative survey\/interview methods, and will help you to develop an open-ended survey or semi-structured interview if that fits your projects' needs.","Most helpful if you are actively working on developing a survey for your own research."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.20","workload":"3.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"7","response rate":"57.14","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 2011","course_id":"11361","cat_num":"110225","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 2011","course_id":"11361","cat_num":"86602","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 2011","course_id":"11361","cat_num":"110225","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
