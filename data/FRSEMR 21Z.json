If you're interested in the topic, go for it. You'll learn a lot and Mr. Mahadevan really makes you think about certain ideas. However, if you're not that interested, do not take this class; it will bore you to death.","very interesting and fun class","This class does not require much work, since it is a seminar. If you are able and interested to understand math and probability at a high level, it would probably be a great fit. If not, you'll have a lot of trouble keeping up."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.10","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.30","enrollment":"6","response rate":"116.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 21Z","course_id":"13024","cat_num":"159833","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 21Z","course_id":"13024","cat_num":"159833","1s":"4","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
