You will do a lot of reading, be exposed to a wide variety of fascinating texts, and learn a lot!","It's great.","Intellectual history is an interdisciplinary field and its study is therefore relevant to students to a wide range of disciplines. Despite not being a student of European literature and history, I found this class invaluable to my education, even critical to my intellectual development. The class has endowed me with greater appreciation and sophisticated understanding of the history of my intellectual community. I have cultivated a much better understanding of myself as a scholar in history and the humanities. In fact, I would recommend this class to any person in the humanities and hope that similar courses will be offered in the future.","You are exposed to a lot of important texts, which is fundamentally useful for any aspiring literary scholar or historian. Teaches you to think critically about your own disciplines."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.57","workload":"2.71","difficulty":"3.29","recommendation":"4.43","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPLIT 215","course_id":"547","cat_num":"60867","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPLIT 215","course_id":"547","cat_num":"60867","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPLIT 215","course_id":"547","cat_num":"60867","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
