It definitely took a strong background in French, but I learned a lot. Professor Bouju was so wonderful - he was always willing and available to meet outside of class, and he was encouraging, helpful, and considerate. I really cannot say enough positive things about him. The class itself was hard, but it was rewarding. We read a lot, and some of the books I liked more than others, but I always appreciated the book following the class even if I didn't before.","This was definitely one of my favorite classes I have taken at Harvard .the literature was so interesting, and the class style was what I dream all Harvard classes would be like- small, round table discussions with the professor and other passionate students. Definitely take notes when you are reading the books and even take notes all on a separate sheet of paper with page numbers written down of good excerpts so that during discussion you are quick to comment.","The books will be a bit daunting at first, but the discussions about them will shed a lot of light!","This is a fabulous course that explores contemporary French literature; discussion is very engaging and the ideas are interesting. You should have an interest in doing close reading texts and interpretation."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"4.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRENCH 280","course_id":"12791","cat_num":"80674","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRENCH 280","course_id":"12791","cat_num":"80674","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
