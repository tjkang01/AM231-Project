Not only is it a subject you don't see everyday, Dr. Rapti is so awesome and brings in so many interesting speakers that relate to Greek Theatre.  You will never get bored!!","This is a fantastic course. Professor Rapti is great and it isn't too much work. You will greatly enjoy the readings and the ensuing discussions.","I came into this class not knowing anything about Modern Greek theatre, but that completely changed through the semester. A highlight of the class was taking a trip to see a shadow puppet play. The readings were all relevant and interesting, and the assignments were well balanced and not overwhelming while still being educational. Professor Rapti is absolutely wonderful and is always willing to answer questions or help students. Definitely a class that I recommend."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"1.60","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MODGRK 104","course_id":"5020","cat_num":"46277","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MODGRK 104","course_id":"5020","cat_num":"46277","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MODGRK 104","course_id":"5020","cat_num":"46277","1s":"2","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
