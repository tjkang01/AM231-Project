Her assignments are a mix of academic \/ creative, and she really went the extra mile by taking us all out to a play in the city! This is a good class to take if you want to learn about a lot of different topics in a short amount of time.","This fantastic class allowed me to learn about, view, and discuss theater and performances from a variety of non-Western traditions, spanning many years.","This is a great course. Readings are manageable, and Prof. Kim is a great (and accessible) professor who will take the time to engage you individually. A large chunk of the grade rests on the final project and final paper (which deals partially with the final project), so there is a chance to exercise your own creativity and pay tribute to perhaps your favorite performances or topics of the term. Pick a subject you really care about and you will have very little trouble. The more you put into this course, the more you'll get out of it.","Take this class!  Professor Kim is absolutely wonderful, and the subject material is fascinating.","This is a great class with an excellent professor and interesting readings. I would wholeheartedly recommend it!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"4.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"8","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 180C","course_id":"13108","cat_num":"159664","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 180C","course_id":"13108","cat_num":"159664","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
