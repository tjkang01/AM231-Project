Highly recommended!","The material in this class is not easy, but one will learn a lot in the class. This is both because of the focus on primary material in Arabic, and because of Professor El-Rouayheb's excellent teaching. It definitely helps to know Arabic as much as possible in order to decipher some of the difficulties in the class, but it can also be quite useful and beneficial to meet in groups to go over the texts outside of class after working on it oneself.","Equal parts important for those that are interested in the topic (i.e. wahdat al-wujud) and those interested in improving their reading comprehension of dense classical texts.","This class will push you beyond your limits, linguistically, historically, and philosophically. I do believe, however, that unless this course is instructed by Prof. El'Rouayheb himself, I would not be able to assure one of the quality.
