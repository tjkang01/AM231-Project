Readings are very light, and Professor Lanni always brings delicious food! The discussion is typically balanced between the week's readings and a more universal discussion of law codes. It definitely helps to have some background in Ancient Greece to provide context, but it is entirely possible to take and enjoy the class without any.","If you love Law and the Classics, this is the freshman seminar for you! Professor Lanni's knowledge on Ancient Athenian law is unending, and the way the class is structured \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a comparison between Ancient Greek and modern law \u00e2\u20ac\u201c expanded my knowledge about both the ancient and the modern world.","If you like law and the classics take this course, if not it gets dull.","Professor Lanni is wonderful. Discussions in this class were always engaging, and readings were interesting, but manageable. The topic of the class is also fascinating and much more applicable to the current day than one might think.","This seminar was lots of fun and I definitely recommend it if you are interested in either ancient Athens or modern law!","Such an incredible course and amazing professor. She was an incredible source of insight and guidance especially for those interested in pursuing a career in law.","Trials in Ancient Athens is a fantastic course that provides an introduction to both law and classics. The small group discussions are what makes Freshman Seminars like this so popular. I was able to make some good friends in the class and learned a lot!","It was by no means my most exciting course, but I enjoyed it and found some of the readings very interesting. The professor was very friendly and brought fruit to every class, which was actually a huge plus because Annenberg fruit can sometimes be disappointing.","The class does not take much time and it is very interesting with a great professor."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"2.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"13","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 31P","course_id":"10803","cat_num":"109474","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"4","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 31p","course_id":"10803","cat_num":"59648","1s":"3","2s":"8","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 31P","course_id":"10803","cat_num":"109474","1s":"6","2s":"7","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
