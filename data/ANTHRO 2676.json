The class will be a lot of extra work if you are going in blind. Be careful about who's in the class. Graduate students can talk too much and criticize too much. The class would be better if Prof. Ahmed took more control over the discussions. That way everyone could have a better understanding of the material instead of just criticizing the material.","Difficult but worth it.","Only do it if you enjoy theory.","The teaching is thorough and well organized and the support you receive is reassuring. This is very intense and challenging course. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Even if you are not interested the course, the way it is taught provides an excellent way of thinking about theory and some of the key issues in not only anthropology, but in social sciences in general."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"7.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 2676","course_id":"10665","cat_num":"110034","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 2676","course_id":"10665","cat_num":"84531","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 2676","course_id":"10665","cat_num":"110034","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
