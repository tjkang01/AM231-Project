It is very interesting and Professor Rinard is a great professor. It is, however, very specific and epistemological in nature, so make sure you know what you're getting into.","This class was pretty fun. Professor Rinard is an excellent teacher, and her enthusiasm is great. The class is pretty laid back, the only graded assignments are four papers. The class topic, skepticism, is very interesting, and it turned into a great way to learn about topics in epistemology in general.","This is a great course because it provides an overview of different stances that can really impact other domains of philosophy, and are interesting in and of themselves. Professor Rinard is an enthusiastic teacher and adept at laying out and delving into philosophical arguments with students.","Be brave! Take it! This course will test your limits about thinking philosophically and doubting the things that we take so easily for granted. I can see how some people may raise the question, \"but why would you doubt that?\" but trying to doubt these things is exactly the kind of experience that you should be having at college. This course will show you the expansive intellectual life that you can have, if you're so inclined to doubt."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHIL 159s","course_id":"12569","cat_num":"47696","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHIL 159s","course_id":"12569","cat_num":"47696","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
