I hope to continue learning Cape Verdean Creole with Ines if my schedule permits!","Everyone should take a class in the African language department before they graduate!"]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["The exposure to culture and linguistics related to Cape Verde was unmatched and the support I received from my instructor was amazing."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["This is a wonderful class. Nezi is a wonderful and really accommodating instructor! She makes sure that all her students understand the material before moving on to the next topic. The course also involves field trips where you get to learn more about Cape Verdean culture hands on and eat amazing Cape Verdean food!
