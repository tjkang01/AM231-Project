This course requires a lot of reading, but by the end of it, you'll be impressed with how much you've learned.","Stephen is incredibly enthusiastic about the 18-C! He's a new Professor and still learning the ropes, but he's very open to feedback and very keen to help his students. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of the texts being covered, so it's a real treat to come into office hours and hear him make connections between different writers and scholars. The Enlightenment is an incredibly rich period full of brilliant philosophers and novelists, and there's so much to learn, even for students who don't plan on being specialists.","That the readings are excellent and the professor is very positive and enthusiastic about the material, which helped discussion and everyone's interest in the course"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.90","workload":"11.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"11","response rate":"63.64","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 291C","course_id":"13233","cat_num":"160007","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 291C","course_id":"13233","cat_num":"160007","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
