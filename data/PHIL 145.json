The opinion is false because I can confirm that this course as it was taught in Spring 2017 was one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard. I learned a lot and the lectures by the instructor are always fun to go to. The choice of examples and illustrations are humorous, always fresh and relatable. This being said, you will have to work hard in order to do well. The instructor has designed the course in such a way that how you perform actually reflects the amount of personal effort you put in. He explains clearly and one can see that the instructor really wants us to understand.","Professor Richard is really entertaining and dedicated to making this class a good experience for everyone -- if you're interested and willing to put in some time with him, I recommend it even if you don't have much logic background.","Get help early when you need it, prepare to struggle."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHIL 145","course_id":"12567","cat_num":"156023","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"12","4s":"24","5s":"41"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHIL 145","course_id":"12567","cat_num":"156023","1s":"25","2s":"42","3s":"9","4s":"2","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
