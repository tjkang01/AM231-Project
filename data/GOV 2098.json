As such, treatment of many topics was superficial and more problematically - jumped around a lot so that it was hard to follow at times.","Great for fulfilling theory requirement","Take a theory course on theory for its own sake, like 1061. You won't learn theory here, you'll just learn how to have futile arguments with theorists. Rather than awkwardly forcing disciplines together, just learn theory as theory. Its interesting, worthwhile, and enjoyable on its own, without any reference to political science."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"2.75","workload":"1.33","difficulty":"2.45","recommendation":"2.92","enrollment":"16","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 2098","course_id":"2264","cat_num":"23817","1s":"2","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 2098","course_id":"2264","cat_num":"23817","1s":"2","2s":"2","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 2098","course_id":"2264","cat_num":"23817","1s":"8","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
