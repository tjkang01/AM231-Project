The materials chosen to articulate an image of modern Brazil were just perfect (a nice balance between original and rare documents and canonical texts and music).","This course shows a blind spot in Latin American critical theory. It is dedicated to establish the role of music in the study of Brazilian, but also in other Spanish speaking areas, as a fundamental object of study. It is also one of the few courses in which you can speak rigorously, freely and critically about problems of race and gender beyond the identity politics that usually drown these discourses. Dylon's generosity is, for sure, the reason why it all works so smoothly.","This is the best course I have taken at Harvard so far. The professor knows the subject extremely well, he is engaging and very welcoming, and knows how to direct discussion in the most productive way. Just be patient with his management of time.","This is a great course to either get into brazilian literature, music and film or continue your research in it. We had \"pros\" and \"amateurs\" in the field and the dynamic and contents, as were laid by professor Robbins, allowed for everybody to benefit from the course. Also, professor Robbins is an expert in the three artistic disciplines and can draw upon a number of interesting relatioships between them."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"9.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"8","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PORTUG 230","course_id":"14000","cat_num":"161295","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PORTUG 230","course_id":"14000","cat_num":"161295","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
