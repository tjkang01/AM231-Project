His comments are tremendously useful and detailed. The novels you will study in this class vary widely in time, style, and subject, and are carefully selected and ordered to scaffold your thinking about the broader interactions of the novel with poetry, philosophy, and catastrophic historical events. Many of the novels (as well as the poetry) we read will surely remain texts I return to again and again in future writing\/research.","The reading and writing requirements may seem daunting, as might the sheer difficulty\/opacity of some of the literature on the syllabus, but embracing them will turn out to be hugely productive!","Prof Fisher is outstanding, but be aware that the reading for the course is somewhat eclectic and erratic (which I loved, but might feel a bit unmooring)","Good but time consuming","The course is good but be prepared for a depressing reading list."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"3.60","difficulty":"3.90","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"17","response rate":"64.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 260","course_id":"10777","cat_num":"88532","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 260","course_id":"10777","cat_num":"88532","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"8","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 260","course_id":"10777","cat_num":"88532","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"3","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
