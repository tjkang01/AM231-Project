If there is any German author worth creating a course around, W. G. Sebald is definitely the right one to pick.","Take this course even if you don't know who W.G. Sebald was. You will soon find out, and in the meantime, you'll learn more about German literary history than you might have expected.","Excellent subject taught by an expert."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.83","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GERMAN 290","course_id":"2123","cat_num":"7036","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GERMAN 290","course_id":"2123","cat_num":"7036","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GERMAN 290","course_id":"2123","cat_num":"7036","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
