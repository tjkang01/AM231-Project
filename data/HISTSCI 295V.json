Sometimes expectations around assignments and participation were unclear -- but there weren't any particularly negative consequences of this, just some confusion, so as long as you're not bothered by loose requirements you'll be fine. The workload was light, the topics interesting, and the classroom atmosphere very relaxed. I enjoyed the course.","Take this course if you'd like to learn from a brilliant mind within the field of history of science.","Pay attention to Oren!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"7.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"8","response rate":"62.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HISTSCI 295V","course_id":"13106","cat_num":"160707","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HISTSCI 295V","course_id":"13106","cat_num":"160707","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
