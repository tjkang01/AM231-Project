If not, don't waste your time because you'll be bored.","It is definitely a good adn relaxed introduction to postcolonialism as a whole. It is not as rigorous as certaind epartmental courses but works very well as a Freshman seminar."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This is a really interesting class to take. The readings can be eye-opening, and Professor Priam can provide a great perspective. She's really enthusiastic and warm, and generates a really good class environment. Note that fairly strong French listening skills are probably required (though you can talk or write in English if you like).","This seminar was fantastic, and Prof. Priam is an amazing teacher. It really changed the way I think about the world.","Mylene is a wonderful teacher! She leads and encourages discussions and creates passion in students for her class. The readings are very exciting, and, if you have good knowledge of French, I definitely recommend taking this class! If you end up taking it (I hope you do because you won't regret it!), make the most out of it! This is a very exciting Freshman Seminar!","This is by far the best course that I will ever take at Harvard. It changed the way that I looked at myself and the way that I look at the world."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Si vous aimez le fran\u00c3\u00a7ais et cherchez une classe assez facile, prenez cette classe! \r\nIl est tr\u00c3\u00a8s \u00c3\u00a9vident que Pr. Priam adore son travail. Elle fait de bons efforts pour que sa classe soit int\u00c3\u00a9ressante et captivante pour ses \u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a8ves. Tout d'abord, je sugg\u00c3\u00a8re qu'avant de choisir ce cours-ci, vous r\u00c3\u00a9visiez votre fran\u00c3\u00a7ais. En classe, on ne parle que le fran\u00c3\u00a7ais; il faut donc qu'on se sente \u00c3\u00a0 l'aise en s'exprimant dans cette langue-l\u00c3\u00a0. Il n'est pas cependant tout n\u00c3\u00a9cessaire que vous parliez le fran\u00c3\u00a7ais, juste que vous le compreniez. Vous pouvez \u00c3\u00a9crire soit en fran\u00c3\u00a7ais soit en anglais. En gros, je recommande cette classe pour tous ceux qui s'int\u00c3\u00a9ressent vraiment au monde francophone et veulent approfondir leurs connaissances de la colonisation. En outre, il n'y a pas trop de travail. Les lectures donnent tr\u00c3\u00a8s envie d'en savoir plus, mais la seule chose, c'est qu'elles sont parfois difficile de comprendre. Si vous comptez vous sp\u00c3\u00a9cialiser en fran\u00c3\u00a7ais (Francophone Studies) ou bien en Romance Studies, il est probable que ce s\u00c3\u00a9minaire compte pour quelques cr\u00c3\u00a9dits. Si vous voulez une citation en fran\u00c3\u00a7ais, cette classe peut \u00c3\u00a9galement compter. \r\n\r\nD'ailleurs, moi, je ne suis pas fran\u00c3\u00a7ais, donc ne pensez pas qu'il faut \u00c3\u00aatre fran\u00c3\u00a7ais pour jouir de cette classe.","Take a trip throughout history, culture, and the human consciousness, as you learn how it could be possible to build on the ashes left by colonialism in Africa and the Caribbean. It's super fun and pretty low key, and yet you find yourself wanting to do your best work!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"1.50","difficulty":"2.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 31o","course_id":"1825","cat_num":"6293","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 31o","course_id":"1825","cat_num":"6293","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 31o","course_id":"1825","cat_num":"6293","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
