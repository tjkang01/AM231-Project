Dr. Todd is an excellent professor (the best in his field) and I would very much encourage taking this course with him if one has the opportunity to do so."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["I very much enjoyed this course.  It offered an opportunity to read works of Russian pastoral literature that I hadn't previously heard of, and most were quite enjoyable.  The reading load was quite manageable each week.  Class sessions usually involved some brief remarks by Prof. Todd (who is a fantastic professor) and one or two talks by students on the readings followed by class discussion.  I would highly recommend this course for anyone with an interest in the Russian gentry\/peasantry or rural literature.","Take this class. Prof. Todd is a brilliant mind and very kind man at the top of his field, and having a seminar with him is so valuable. The structure of the course is so awesome with presentations, book reviews and a final paper, I wish more courses were like this! Also since there are so many grad students it just feels like some nice, chill, interesting people talking about Russian Lit, not a bunch of high-strung sleep-deprived A-hungry undergrads like in most seminars\/Gen-eds.","Professor Todd is wonderful. You will get out of this class what you put into it. The readings are so great. This class isn't life-changing, but it is thoroughly enjoyable.","A lot of reading, all of which is rural and 19th century, but if that is at all interesting to you it's a great course with a great professor","Professor Todd is a brilliant, deeply erudite, and remarkably kind scholar--and if you have a chance to take this course with him I would not pass it up. For me, it was a foray into an entirely new literary and sociological field, and Professor Todd offered the perfect transition into that material--providing just enough contextual information and then consistently asking us to nuance many of our pre-conceptions about the pastoral throughout the course. I feel that from this one seminar I have gained a unique overview of the Russian literary tradition--not told merely through the canonical epic novels, but through this more sideways perspective that gives great insight into the central narrative. I would also add that the assignments are very well structured--two review papers, two presentations, and a final essay--so that you can develop a set of personal interests throughout the class that can be broad but will culminate very well in the final essay. All my recommendations!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"8.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"10","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SLAVIC 157","course_id":"4563","cat_num":"108353","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"SLAVIC 157","course_id":"4563","cat_num":"108353","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
