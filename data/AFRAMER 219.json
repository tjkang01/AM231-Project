Professor de la Fuente is both so learned and engaging, and a great discussion leader. In terms of the curriculum, the readings are quite wide ranging \u00e2\u20ac\u201d chronologically, thematically, and methodologically. This course is a great introduction to histories of race and ethnicity, slavery and indigenous movements for those who might be already familiar with some of those topics in a different context (e.g. the United States). The final paper is also a good opportunity to draft an article or chip away at dissertation research."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"9.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"10","response rate":"30.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
