But do make time for the primary readings (I know when there's a lot of writing, this is the first thing to go for many).","Any chance to cover these poets with Stephen Burt is worth taking. I would warn them that there is a lot of reading and writing (but I would also advise them: this is not a bad thing). I might tell them that it helps to have read and written on some of this poetry and criticism beforehand, but I'd also add that it's not a prerequisite.","You will work hard, you will think deeply, you will write a lot, and when it's all over, you will be very grateful that you took it."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This is an outstanding class. It's a lot of work, but really rewarding it if you want to learn more about poetry or are already invested in it.","This course is a unique opportunity to engage with a variety of poetry in an intriguing and complex manner. It offers a chance for both close reading and theoretical contextualization."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"10.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"18","response rate":"44.44","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 279","course_id":"10781","cat_num":"130676","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 279","course_id":"10781","cat_num":"42451","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"6","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 279","course_id":"10781","cat_num":"130676","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
