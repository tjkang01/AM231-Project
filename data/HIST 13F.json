Professor More is awesome. Our readings were very interesting, and I'm not even usually into social history - I'm more into economic history. This was such a cool angle to explore history through, and I ended up learning a lot about current women's conditions in America. Discussions were super thought-provoking, two hours really flew by. The end of the semester paper was hard work, but so much fun to chew on!","Professor More is very very knowledgable about the topics discussed.  I would highly recommend taking any of her classes if you want to dig in deep on a topic and learn more about it.  It would be good to have some context\/background on your own if not super familiar with U.S. history (or have forgotten from high school)","Take this course! Its a wonderful way to fulfill a seminar requirement in the history department. Professor More is truly a gem -- totally willing to help you in every step of the way.","This is a very interesting course. Professor More has chosen an excellent set of readings, and through the readings and engaging class discussions on them you will learn a lot about both the history of women and work in the United States and also the current situation. You are required to choose a research topic early in the semester, so come in with some idea of what you would like to do."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"5.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"9","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 13F","course_id":"13721","cat_num":"160424","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 13F","course_id":"13721","cat_num":"160424","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
