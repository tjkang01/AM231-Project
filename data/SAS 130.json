It is a course that does not simply focus on development policy but ideas of equality, rights, cities, etc. Economy in this class takes on various meanings from economic life of individuals to development policy.","This is a great class and Professor Amrith is an amazing teacher! If you have the slightest interest in South Asia or economic history take this course! Not only are the readings and seminar discussions very intellectually rewarding, but this is also on of the few courses at Harvard where economic history is taught from the perspective of a historian. I've been trying to find my balance in the study of economic history for 2 years now, and this class finally helped me understand the beauty of the discipline and why it's an emerging stream of study. The class also became very close and so this was personally a very good experience overall!","An amazing course. Sunil Amrith is quite possibly one of the best professors I have had at Harvard - take this course for his guidance!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"6.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"8","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SAS 130","course_id":"13003","cat_num":"160720","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"SAS 130","course_id":"13003","cat_num":"160720","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
