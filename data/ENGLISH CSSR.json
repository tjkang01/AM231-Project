Relaxed, seminar-style discussion of film and fiction, low-stress way to learn about and practice storytelling. Could use maybe a little more structure, but overall a fantastic class.","This class did teach me quite a bit about how stories function. I think we could have jumped into writing our screenplays (and potentially writing multiple short screenplays) earlier on in the course. But overall this was an enjoyable experience."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"3.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"9","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH CSSR","course_id":"13904","cat_num":"160960","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH CSSR","course_id":"13904","cat_num":"160960","1s":"2","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
