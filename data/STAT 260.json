It is a lot of work during the semesters for homework and projects.  However, it does not have mid-terms and finals.  For me, it is a good trade-off.  You can spread out the work throughout the semester instead of concentrating effects during the exams.\r\n\r\nThe projects are quite good and you learn something from it.  They are not easy and needs a lot of work.","Those from HSPH should consider carefully if this is the right course for them."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Overall great class! The class was well-organized and the material was presented well. There are weekly assignments and three projects. This format reinforces the material well without being overly difficult or repetitive. I felt like I learned a ton about survey design and analysis, without the class being overly stressful or difficult."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"STAT 260","course_id":"4857","cat_num":"126393","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"STAT 260","course_id":"4857","cat_num":"59588","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"STAT 260","course_id":"4857","cat_num":"126393","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
