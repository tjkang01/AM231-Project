When you do the reading, it is really interesting.","If you're interested in medical anthropology and specifically in Arthur Kleinman's work, then this is a must-take class. If you are at all ambivalent, however, the two hours and heavy readings might drag a little.","you have to like the material, particularly biology and sciences, to enjoy this class","This is a high level class but it's also very accessible.
