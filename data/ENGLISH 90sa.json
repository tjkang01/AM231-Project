You will never think about the theatre in the same way again. I am not an actor and did not even love theatre that much at the start of the class, but the course really transformed the way I view literary works and the assignments were wonderful opportunities to connect with both the works themselves and the greater historical background the carry. It's amazing how much of modern theatre we have inherited from the past, and the theatre as an medium for recreation has always lent itself to the forefront of controversial societal movements. Very much worth your while.","This class was possibly my favorite so far at Harvard. As someone heavily involved in the arts, it enriched my understanding of the theater and positively influenced my approach to performance. If you do not take this class, and do not experience Prof. Scanlan's complete mastery of theater, you are sorely missing out.","The class sounds great and the reading list is fantastic, but at least 90% of every two-hour class (not kidding) is taken up by the lectures, which are rambling and incohesive, and only even related to stuff we'd read two-thirds of the time (one of those thirds being rehash from earlier lectures about earlier plays). On the flip side, the only assignments are weekly response papers (you don't even need to read the plays since you'll never speak in class) and a final project that can be anything you want, so it's practically no work.","This class will introduce you to questions that you will wrestle with for the rest of your life about fate and free will, relationships, acceptance, and the role of art in life.","Read the plays they are actually all wonderful.","take it if it becomes a lecture or there's some try-out to get in cause student discussions were so much worse than prof's comments"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"13","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 90sa","course_id":"10753","cat_num":"95466","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 90sa","course_id":"10753","cat_num":"95466","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"8","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 90sa","course_id":"10753","cat_num":"95466","1s":"3","2s":"7","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
