The course is more geared toward the literary perspective, less on the historical, I think, which was slightly unexpected, but it is also an aspect that is often overlooked. This course thus remains relevant and fresh to a Three Kingdoms fanatic as much as it is for one without any prior knowledge.","This is a really fun course, but at the same time you get to learn a lot about Chinese history and culture. I strongly recommend this course if you're interested in east Asian studies.","This is a really great class if you have an interest in the Three Kingdoms. Last year was the first year it was taught, so there was less structure, but the material is interesting and Professor Tian is engaging."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.71","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"2.43","recommendation":"4.86","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EASTD 129","course_id":"835","cat_num":"20018","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EASTD 129","course_id":"835","cat_num":"20018","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EASTD 129","course_id":"835","cat_num":"20018","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
