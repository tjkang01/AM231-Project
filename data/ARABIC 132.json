I learned more about grammar and style in one semester than I have over three years. The assignments are interesting, but not overwhelming, and class is always fun. It's a good way to not only keep up but also improve your Arabic if you don't want to take 241 or classical.","The course title may sound boring, but the course provides an intensive and highly productive forum for learning Arabic at an advanced level.","If you want to improve your Arabic writing skills, this course is key!","Professor Nevenka Korica Sullivan is an excellent lecturer and pedagog! I would highly encourage everyone and anyone who is interested in reviewing grammar, and learning Arab-style writing techniques to take this class! Professor Sullivan, thank you for an amazing semester!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.17","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ARABIC 132","course_id":"3745","cat_num":"74782","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ARABIC 132","course_id":"3745","cat_num":"74782","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ARABIC 132","course_id":"3745","cat_num":"74782","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
