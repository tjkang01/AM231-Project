This course allows you to pursue your own research interests within a framework that ensures that you are not alone in the process.  The skills you learn extend far beyond this course.","This class is definitely one of the most challenging courses I've taken at Harvard, but also one of the most rewarding. In particular, it was a great preview and warm-up for dissertation-writing.","Begin research over the summer!","Take it! This class is demanding but worth your time. Liz is an amazing professor, and the workshop format is very useful. It is incredible to read your peers' work and get their feedback on your own writing.","This is a great course to learn how to write a good research paper in three months. The amount of time required for reading, research and writing for this class, however, makes it difficult to take many courses simultaneously."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This is the best research seminar I have ever taken at Harvard. It is a ton of work, but as long you start thinking about what project you would like to do a few months before the course begins, it will be a richly rewarding experience. I cannot recommend highly enough.","This is a rigorous, step-by-step exploration of a historical research paper from start to finish.  The time spent on course work increases as the semester progresses, but the time investment is worth it. Students will leave the class with a very polished paper.","Start working in the summer and try not to take four classes.","I would recommend this class without reservation to any PhD student studying American history. It is a fantastic course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.88","workload":"3.86","difficulty":"4.50","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"8","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 2461","course_id":"2494","cat_num":"1270","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 2461","course_id":"2494","cat_num":"1270","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"4"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 2461","course_id":"2494","cat_num":"1270","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
