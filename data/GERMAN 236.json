Discussion and application of theory turn out too short.","If you are interested in theory and in getting to know a great instructor, this is the course for you!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"8.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GERMAN 236","course_id":"13062","cat_num":"159641","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"GERMAN 236","course_id":"13062","cat_num":"159641","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
