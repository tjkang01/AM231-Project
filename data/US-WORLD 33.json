I knew nothing about the material before I took the course, and I'm really glad that I took it.","This course is an excellent way to learn more about African-American history and in particular African-American religion.","I learned SO MUCH about the history of our country regarding really important radicalized events and issues, and I really liked it for that aspect. However, it is half graduate students from the Div school who eat undergrads alive daily, so if you don't want to feel constantly shamed by their death glares you better be extremely assertive and read every book 6 times.","Be prepared to work hard and read a lot!","The content of this class was incredibly interesting and important. However, there was an almost ridiculous amount of reading for a Gen Ed. Also, this semester, the class was made up of about 50% divinity school grad students. So if you're an undergrad looking to try something new with this class, beware: your fellow students will actively try to make you feel dumb.","this course was really engaging and interesting","Amazing class, amazing teaching staff, there's simply a lot of readings","This class will teach you a lot. It will be interesting. It will also be intimidating and scary to try to talk in class if you have as many graduate students as we did. Sometimes the course felt more like a graduate seminar than an undergraduate gen ed course. There will be far too much reading for you to do per week, but if you skim most of the readings, you will be okay. Not your typical gen ed."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"4.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.40","enrollment":"17","response rate":"82.35","QCourseOverall":{"number":"US-WORLD 33","course_id":"2080","cat_num":"8058","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"5","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"US-WORLD 33","course_id":"2080","cat_num":"8058","1s":"1","2s":"10","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
