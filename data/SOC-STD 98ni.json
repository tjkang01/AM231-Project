I would recommend this for anyone interested in challenging the assumptions of neoclassical economics and for anyone interested in understanding how financial markets really work.","Anush is fantastic.  Although he lectures a little too much sometimes, he truly has a unique perspective and one worth hearing.  Take this course.","Definitely background in higher-than-Ec10 economics course required. I was totally unprepared. Learned a lot, but did not feel comfortable contributing frequently to discussion. Anush is fantastic, and the other students in the course challenged me a lot.","Anush is a great teacher, and you will certainly take a lot away from your experience in this tutorial."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.43","workload":"2.14","difficulty":"3.43","recommendation":"4.43","enrollment":"8","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOC-STD 98ni","course_id":"4617","cat_num":"31346","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOC-STD 98ni","course_id":"4617","cat_num":"31346","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOC-STD 98ni","course_id":"4617","cat_num":"31346","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
