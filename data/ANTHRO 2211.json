You will learn so much more about the practice of archaeology and heritage management in different parts of the world. And you will end up getting so many new ideas about how to apply what you learn in the region you are working in!","This is a wonderful discussion-oriented course about the ways in which archaeology has interacted with the public over time, and why such a project should be a goal of the discipline. Although there are readings and a general regional theme, the class is grounded in the experiences of its participants (including guest lecturers) with the central theme.","Asking questions about \"heritage\" should be a requirement for all archaeology students (undergrads, grads, and anyone from any department who works with the remains of the past). You should take it because its important!","This class is like getting a behind the scenes tour of  archaeological sites and the tourism industry across the world -- fascinating and challenging!!"]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Such a great course. No archaeology background needed! Great opportunity to think about how spaces and objects are viewed and valued. Fascinating case studies from around the world.","This course was a great way to learn more about heritage management and from an amazing professor. We were able to learn how heritage management works in different countries, and it gave me a much better perspective of how different issues can be handled outside of the United States. Also, different professors come into class to discuss their work--and that was a really great way to learn from people working in different areas.","If you want to understand how archaeology relates practically to the \"real world\", this is the class for you."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"5.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 2211","course_id":"13903","cat_num":"160955","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 2211","course_id":"13903","cat_num":"160955","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
