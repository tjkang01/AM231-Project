Perfect for China newbies like me.","good material on china.  not a super interesting class though in terms of time spent in class","It is a great class and you will learn a lot, but it requires a lot of work. The \"midterm\" is more akin to a final and the final paper can be demanding if you are not used to writing economic papers.","If you're genuinely interested in the subject, then you will definitely like the class.
