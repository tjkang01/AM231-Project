The amount of work required of the course could make it overwhelming.","The course will push you, but it's well worth the effort - your Tibetan will definitely improve and you will also grow as a scholar.  It's an amazing learning experience.","It will be great to take this course if you plan to continue Tibetan studies. Prof. van der Kuijp is a great model of passionate and meticulous scholarship. But you have to make sure you have a good grounding on Tibetan language and a passion\/interest for Madhyamika philosophy."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":null,"difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"4","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"TIBET 203","course_id":"12093","cat_num":"125167","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"TIBET 203","course_id":"12093","cat_num":"125167","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
