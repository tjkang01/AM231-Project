It was a lot of work, and it wasn't easy, but the kind of thinking we did was very different from the kind of thinking you usually do at Harvard. It offers a great opportunity to learn, but also to let yourself be creative. I highly recommend the class. I'd take it again in a heartbeat.","For those who enjoyed Transformations, definitely consider building on your design skills in this class!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"12.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 96B","course_id":"11490","cat_num":"110362","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 96B","course_id":"11490","cat_num":"110362","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
