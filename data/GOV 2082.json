For that alone, Professor Tuck's thoroughness is appreciated. But the reading is hard, and the class is very competent. It's easy to feel inadequate in the class, but going through the canonical works is enough to make it worth it. Not a class for beginners."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"4.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"11","response rate":"54.55","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 2082","course_id":"12416","cat_num":"59529","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 2082","course_id":"12416","cat_num":"59529","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
