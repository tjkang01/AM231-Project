Choose your projects carefully or else they could be very labor intensive.","This course is interesting but disorganized.  It will probably be much better in the future once a rubric is set and a more concrete syllabus is finalized.","Recommend insofar as they will improve on it from this year; if Heidi is teaching next year, take it- she's awesome","Not worth it. You don't learn anything. One of the profs is all about India not the UN","An excellent, eye-opening course, but not one to take if you like clarity in terms of work expected.","Great class on an interesting topic. Unique format in that the involvement with the UN makes it more interesting and relevant to the real world. The field trip to NYC was awesome.","If you like for your classes to have structure, you will be very frustrated.","The expectations in this course are very vague.","The class sessions and readings were very interesting, and if you have a specific interest that you can envision turning into final projects, then it's a rewarding class.","It was fun, and as much as you make of it. But, students should be warned about group work and focus on India and economics","It's fare more narrow than most courses you'll take at Harvard, but a worthwhile endeavor nonetheless. The professors are great, and the side benefits, particular the trips to the UN, opportunity to learn from top-officials, are among the best at Harvard. The year I took it, the class was new, so the assignments were somewhat unstructured, and the discussions tended to be one-sided. The professors are conscientious enough, though, that these things will improve somewhat by the time you take this course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.76","workload":"1.94","difficulty":"2.35","recommendation":"3.82","enrollment":"23","response rate":"73.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1968","course_id":"2462","cat_num":"59002","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"6","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1968","course_id":"2462","cat_num":"59002","1s":"2","2s":"7","3s":"8","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1968","course_id":"2462","cat_num":"59002","1s":"6","2s":"6","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
