methods that is not discussed in the History Department. This course also is a great opportunity to meet students concentrating on American History outside of the history department.","great introductory course on american history.","For incoming Am Civ students, this class is a must! It covers a wide range of methods and topics in American Studies. And the conversations you have with the authors of the books you read can be incredibly helpful and encouraging as they tend to share their own experiences of grad school and give advice on dissertation work."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This was the most challenging and rewarding course I have ever taken.
