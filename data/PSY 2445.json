This class - if you're lucky enough to be able to enroll - fills that gap in quite nicely. Psychotherapy is a much more controversial and challenging area of clinical psychology than I originally thought. Prof. Nock does a wonderful job of moving the course along in a variety of directions that all tie in together in one way or another. If you're seriously considering doing psychotherapeutic research or do some sort of clinical work in the future, then I highly recommend this course!","One of the best courses I've taken at Harvard - literally revolutionized how I think about research.
