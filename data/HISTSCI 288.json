It is also a wonderful way to get a sense of how to plan a class discussion and juice the most out of hefty readings. The readings are an excellent balance of the theoretical and the historical.","If you are thinking about writing about technology for a senior thesis OR have a general interest in the history of technology (how to write it? etc), then this is the best class at Harvard for your objectives!  Reading is generally pretty helpful in surveying the field.  Professor is very very organized and dedicated to subject matter.","important perspective for anyone in history, economics, design, or the sciences","This is a good course in the history of technology, particularly as it relates to the history of technological artifacts. But the course does not deal as thoroughly with philosophies of technology or non-object specific aspects of technology."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["Get started on the readings early because they are long. This is a mature class with serious discussions.","A good way to think through materialism as well as think through (or around) techno-pessimism in science writing.","This is a great class for interdisciplinary discussion, so I would strongly recommend this course not only to historians of science, but also historians, architects, sociologists, anthropologists etc.","At times there is a lot of reading, but it truly challenged me to engage with various kinds of texts and analyze them in different ways. Again, I think this is an important skill to have. Each seminar was productive and it was a close environment. It was nice that everyone knew everyone's names and valued each and every opinion.","Take a class with Heidi!  It will forever change the way you think about science and technology.  You will get something from it no matter what your starting point. And you will be challenged.","the more active you participate, the more you will get in return.."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.43","workload":"3.29","difficulty":"3.71","recommendation":"4.71","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HISTSCI 288","course_id":"2702","cat_num":"6645","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HISTSCI 288","course_id":"2702","cat_num":"6645","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"5","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HISTSCI 288","course_id":"2702","cat_num":"6645","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"3","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
