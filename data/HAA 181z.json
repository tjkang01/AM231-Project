This class also provided an excellent overview of some of China's most famous artwork, as well as a bit of historical background.  Personally, however, as someone without a background in East Asian art history, I felt somewhat excluded (though not necessarily overtly) from the goings-on of the class, which were somewhat cliquish in my opinion, and did not always feel that divergent perspectives and ideas were welcome.  An environment was not fostered which made me want to try to contribute to class discussion on a regular basis.","A background in Chinese art history and Chinese history would be very helpful.","If you have an interest in ancient Chinese paintings, this is a good class to take. You won't be inundated with many images to memorize, but you will discuss a selection of key paintings in great depth. Plus, Professor Wang is really genial and kind!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.25","workload":"2.25","difficulty":"2.75","recommendation":"3.50","enrollment":"9","response rate":"44.44","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 181z","course_id":"2587","cat_num":"11386","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 181z","course_id":"2587","cat_num":"11386","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 181z","course_id":"2587","cat_num":"11386","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
