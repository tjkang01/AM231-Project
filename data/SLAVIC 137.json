Feedback on written work is also extremely good.","This class delivers exactly what it should: knowledge of the Czech interwar period and all the various art movements that sprang up and crumbled in that time. It's a survey, in a way, but it is still incredibly in-depth, and the professor is fantastic.","This class was my favorite this semester. I learned so much. I looked forward to going to class because I couldn't wait to discuss our readings with the other students in the class who had such great things to add."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.67","difficulty":"4.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"4","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SLAVIC 137","course_id":"4551","cat_num":"9805","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SLAVIC 137","course_id":"4551","cat_num":"9805","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SLAVIC 137","course_id":"4551","cat_num":"9805","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
