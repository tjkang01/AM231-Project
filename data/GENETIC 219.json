genetics, take this course.","This is the best graduate course I've taken anywhere (of > 15, 2 institutions).  Every week after I attended this course, I found myself thinking about my own research and current literature in new ways and from entirely new angles.  This has already proved to be invaluable.  This course isn't for everyone though - it isn't a rigorous, information-driven course, and the 'socratic' style of teaching may not interest all students.  I would happily take this again."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["You can learn a lot with absolutely no stress.","This is the perfect example of what a graduate school course should be: a relaxed, but academically rigorous discussion of interesting and unanswered issues in the field of genetics.","It's the greatest."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Fun class - but require creative thinking and free discussion of ideas.  Don't hesitate to challenge the current paradigm in discussion and try out new ideas.  Furthermore, Prof. Wu provided free lunch.","Definitely take this class if you're interested in genetics.  It goes into great detail about certain schools of thought in genetics that are sure to change the way you think about it.","Excellent and engaging"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["The best course I have taken, I'd recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone with a passing interest in genetics. The instructors make the topics quite compelling, even for those not in the field. It's a great break from normal classes -- no assignments, no readings, no class preparation, just participation and questions.","Awesome, awesome teaching staff.
