Most of the course focuses on two dimensional CFT, but there are also several lectures on CFT in higher dimensions, as well as on recent research trends like the conformal bootstrap. The workload is manageable and you will learn a lot.","This is one of the best advanced physics courses at Harvard. It is not offered often, so make sure you take it when it is available. Xi is a great teacher. Assignments are also quite amazing. They are quite difficult, but you learn a lot while doing them.","That it is a challenging class but it is very interesting and you would learn a lot. It would be better to take it in a semester where you can give enough time to it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"19.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHYSICS 287C","course_id":"13119","cat_num":"160571","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHYSICS 287C","course_id":"13119","cat_num":"160571","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"6"}},"success":true}
