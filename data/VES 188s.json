There are very few opportunities to have such undivided attention from two professors who leads their respective fields.  It was a great experience.","This co-taught course struck an outstanding balance between the two instructor's individual strengths. Primary materials make up most of the assigned readings, and the filmography, an intriguing cross-section of Soviet cinema, develop stimulating discussion as the films build on each other over the semester. Weekly online posts, multiple rounds of discussion-facilitation, and 3 rounds of paper drafting made for a lot of (truly productive) work.","the class is an excellent introduction to early russian film theory, leads to excellent discussions of critical films"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.33","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.67","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 188s","course_id":"5234","cat_num":"47703","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 188s","course_id":"5234","cat_num":"47703","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 188s","course_id":"5234","cat_num":"47703","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
