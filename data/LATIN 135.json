Professor Zanker's selected secondary readings complement the latin extremely well and the discussions in class are very interesting and engaging. Also Prof. Zanker is really accessible outside of class if you have any questions! Great course!","If you want to read Seneca in Latin, Tom offers a great course.","This was a great class. Professor Zanker was a great instructor and also very friendly and approachable. The pace of the class was pretty relaxed for most of the semester, so if you haven't taken a Latin class in a while and are looking for a way to ease back into it, this course would be a great option.","What a great mixture: Seneca and Lucan, two fascinating and unique authors, -- alongside Tom Zanker! Because the syllabus ended up being smaller than advertised, the course sometimes didn't feel totally unified: without reading as large of a selection of each's work, it was often hard to understand what connection our two authors shared (in content, style, ethics, etc.) beyond their relations. That said, the combination of the material and the instructor make this course a not-stressful, pleasant way to fill out a semester in need of some Silver Latin.","Translations were fun, professor is super nice and helpful"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"2.67","recommendation":"4.17","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LATIN 135","course_id":"5012","cat_num":"87311","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"LATIN 135","course_id":"5012","cat_num":"87311","1s":"2","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
