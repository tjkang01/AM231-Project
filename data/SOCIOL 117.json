However, it's not particularly rich content-wise; it's an interesting topic to think about for a couple weeks, but after that it gets a little repetitive and you can predict where the discussion is going to go time after time.","I loved this course! Professor Dromi is absolutely wonderful and was the perfect person to teach this course. The material was fascinating, and we got to compare and contrast a wide range of social traumas that took place around the world. I found myself constantly citing ideas that had been discussed in this course. I loved the freedom that we had for the final paper, and I found myself talking about this course's final paper more than I did for any of my other papers written at Harvard. This course will provide fascinating insight into a truly interesting series of questions and will dramatically change the way you think about your own cultural identity and events that happen around the world! Highly recommend taking this course if you are at all interested in the material.","This course tackled fascinating material, particularly the case studies. Professor Dromi encouraged open discussion and set up the course in a very achievable way. Highly recommend if you are looking for a seminar-type class.","Professor Dromi is aweseome!!!! The material is super interesting and the readings are wonderfully picked out. Discussions were super fun and the workload was totally manageable. By far my favorite class at Harvard.","Awesome class to take, particularly if you enjoy engaging closely with your professor and classmates. This was one of my favorite classes!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"3.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"11","response rate":"81.82","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
