The instructors are fantastic and the small atmosphere makes it really conducive to learning.","The class is really fun and you learn a lot about what actually happens in a scientific laboratory. The field trip to Utah was amazing and totally worth the time commitment."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Great course to get hands-on research experience under some awesome and very knowledgeable and accessible faculty."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["budget your time well. Don't wait to the last week","This was my favorite class at Harvard! You learn about academic culture firsthand and see what research is like. At the end, you feel like you really accomplished something because of the final paper being essentially a research paper like what would be published in an academic journal (albeit one that still needs more data collected for and a lot of work). It's really cool. If you like the topic, you should do it!","This is a great course for anyone with interests in climate change, geochemistry, or exploring a variety of different types of earth science lab work. Be aware that labs may take a lot longer than three hours! Ann and Dave are great at explaining concepts when you ask them for help. You'll come in wondering how you'll ever write a \"publication quality\" paper in four months, but it will be really fulfilling when you get it done.","Fantastic class if you're tired of textbook \/ chalkboard learning and want to do some hands-on, real geoscience. The 2013 instance would perhaps more accurately have been called \"Analytic Methods in Paleoceanography\" than \"Analytic and Field Methods in Geobiology\", though."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"E-PSCI 189","course_id":"689","cat_num":"26288","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"E-PSCI 189","course_id":"689","cat_num":"26288","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"E-PSCI 189","course_id":"689","cat_num":"26288","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
