I loved everything we read, and it was great to spend four weeks on each set of works. You definitely have to like close reading- sometimes we would spend the whole class looking at one or two passages- but for me that was really refreshing (very different from other Enligsh\/lit courses in which you read a book a week). Professor Gu\u00c3\u00a9don is also great! She's so passionate and really interested in getting to know her students.","For Woolf\/Barthes\/Borges loves, you cannot miss it. Very structured course with a great teacher."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"6.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"8","response rate":"37.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPLIT 110","course_id":"13542","cat_num":"132590","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPLIT 110","course_id":"13542","cat_num":"132590","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
