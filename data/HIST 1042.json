It's not interesting enough to be worth all the reading, and having only lectures makes it really hard to engage meaningfully with any of the reading anyway.","This class provides a different argument about the history of the U.S., particularly with regards to the role of labor and imperialism.","The teacher is very open to suggestions about his teaching, and he likes meeting in person with students to talk about the course and their work. If there's something about the class you wish were different or you feel like you need extra help, you should definitely talk to him!","Assignment standards are high. Be ready to treat every history paper like it is an expos paper from a grammar perspective.","Professor Droessler is a great professor and I definitely believe his class is a hidden gem.","The professor is too young and doesn't know what they're doing yet. Wait to take this course when it's better developed and the professor has more experience. The topic is attractive but the readings are a slog and it's mostly nothing you haven't heard before."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.40","workload":"3.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.20","enrollment":"10","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1042","course_id":"13043","cat_num":"160573","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1042","course_id":"13043","cat_num":"160573","1s":"2","2s":"7","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
