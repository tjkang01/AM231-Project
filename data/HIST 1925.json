Anyone interested in colonial history and issues about identity should definitely take the class.","Professor Herzog is brilliant in her approach to this topic - you really feel that she guides you completely and unbiasedly through competing academic debates and the complicated issue of European identity. It really changed the way I read everything, and has definitely improved my writing.","This class involves close reading of one book per week, and a research paper on a topic of your choice. The close reading was useful since we went more slowly and carefully than the average graduate seminar. However, students familiar with the books on the syllabus might not get much more out of them through this class, which assumes minimal prior knowledge.","This class has been my favorite thus far at Harvard. Professor Herzog is amazing- she makes you think, is great to get to know outside of the classroom, and is very willing to help with work. The course has such a variety of readings that it would be impossible to not find something that captivates you. I think that the assignments are excellent\/ different than many classes at Harvard, and the discussion was as a rule amazing. If you love or even like European History, this class is a must take.","Take it if you want to learn about historiography from a witty, intelligent prof!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"13","response rate":"61.54","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1925","course_id":"10938","cat_num":"73331","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1925","course_id":"10938","cat_num":"73331","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1925","course_id":"10938","cat_num":"73331","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
