The lectures don't always help lessen the confusion but that reflects more on the density of the work than the professor's competence. She knows this material intimately; it's just not always easy for a newcomer to understand it a lot of the time.","If you are genuinely interested in the Caribbean, this is a wonderful course! Prof Priam has been one of my favorite professors here; her lectures and responses in discussions are consistently revelatory and the readings are very well chosen.","Heavy reading load and the second half of the course was essentially devoted to Edouard Glissant. Despite the small size of the class, the course was essentially taught as half lecture- half discussion."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"3.50","enrollment":"10","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRENCH 295","course_id":"4412","cat_num":"22596","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRENCH 295","course_id":"4412","cat_num":"22596","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRENCH 295","course_id":"4412","cat_num":"22596","1s":"2","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
