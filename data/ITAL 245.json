Be prepared to take on a lot of reading throughout, and to engage with a hefty archival research project at the end of the semester.","Do the readings - they're so rich, and definitely utilize Professor Schnapp as a resource. They are long, however, so be forewarned that if you're going to take this class and want to get the most out of it, you should do the readings. Professor Schnapp is incredibly bright, and so interested with the subject. He's fantastic, and made the class a pleasure.","It's fantastic, take it!","This is THE class to take with Professor Schnapp. Watching him introduce the course on the first day was nothing short of amazing: we witnessed a true professor, in his prime, whose mastery of the material is matched by the confidence by which he makes it accessible and clear.","Professor Schnapp is an incredibly versatile scholar, and the discussions he leads are always full of intriguing connections and weighty insights.","It is a pleasure to work with Prof. Schnapp but I feel you'll get the most out of this course if you have truly shared interests. Otherwise, it's a lot of reading (compared to other graduate level classes I have taken) and difficult to find your own direction, even spending a ton of time on it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"8.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"11","response rate":"72.73","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
