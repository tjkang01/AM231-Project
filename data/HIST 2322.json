I cannot recommend this seminar enough.","This was the single most meaningful course that I took at Harvard. Prof. Gordon allowed discussions to flow naturally, guiding only when needed to bring out complexities in the text or to suggest other possible exegetical angles. Adorno is himself a mammoth thinker, and I could not fathom delving into his work without appropriate guidance. Prof. Gordon's constant effort to rationally reconstruct seemingly opaque arguments made a notoriously difficult thinker accessible. I couldn't imagine a better instructor for this course. The content of Adorno's texts deeply impacted me. This course was, without exaggeration, life-changing.","Very dense and difficult subject matter, but Prof. Gordon is a master","Great discussions but challenging material, requires a solid background in the history of continental philosophy."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"3.60","difficulty":"4.20","recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"13","response rate":"69.23","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 2322","course_id":"10948","cat_num":"74151","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 2322","course_id":"10948","cat_num":"74151","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"4"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 2322","course_id":"10948","cat_num":"74151","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"5","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
