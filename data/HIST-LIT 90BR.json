It delved into very broad themes such as racism, globalization, neocolonialism and used commodities in Latin America in order to flesh out those themes. Class was very much discussion based and focused on the readings at hand, which came from a variety of sources.","The topics covered in class were super interesting and (like most 90-level seminars in HIst & Lit) a great introduction to the department\/field. I loved its focus on methodology and the process of writing, which I found applicable to other classes. I also liked the different types of papers assigned, like a close-reading vs. argumentative paper vs. book review, etc... I felt like I definitely had a say in the class conversation and found it easy to relate the different readings, themes, and topics together."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"4.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90BR","course_id":"13626","cat_num":"159793","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90BR","course_id":"13626","cat_num":"159793","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
