The readings were well structured and organized into chronological and thematic units, and the lectures were very insightful despite how short each class was.","This is a great class. Professor Tian is one of the foremost scholars of Chinese Literature and she does a great job imparting some of that wisdom. The class does cover a lot of material, but in one sense that's a good thing because it allows you to make a lot of connections. You will get out of this class what you make of it, though: the readings are very reasonable, and the amount you participate is entirely up to you.","Wonderful class. Professor Tian is such an interesting, thoughtful, and sensitive individual. Can't think of a better class on Chinese literature. Take it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"1.75","difficulty":"2.75","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHNSLIT 114","course_id":"795","cat_num":"9028","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHNSLIT 114","course_id":"795","cat_num":"9028","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHNSLIT 114","course_id":"795","cat_num":"9028","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
