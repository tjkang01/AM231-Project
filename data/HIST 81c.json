It will require work, and you will feel uncomfortable if you are unwilling to engage in rigorous dialog with a strong-willed professor. Otherwise, it's an excellent course.","The readings are challenging and extremely interesting, and the discussions are great."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Professor Kishlansky is one of the most knowledgeable professors I have ever had, and he knows the English Civil War inside and out. But be warned that this can make him a bit intimidating. If he makes harsh critiques, don't take them too seriously. They will be helpful for the future, but just know that he is hard on everyone, including himself. I would also recommend that you really engage with the material assigned to read for the class (I read documents two or three times so that I felt that I thoroughly understood them, though that might not be necessary for other people). Don't take this class lightly, and expect to put a lot of work in. However, there is the potential to really get a lot out of this class as well. Also, you really should start working on your research paper early, so that you have time to explore all the research necessary, and so that you have time to ask Professor Kishlansky to guide you in your research.","You have to like the period. Kishlansky is awesome in any case, though (and so is Ruth!)","A great way to fill the research seminar requirement.  The time period is interesting, and Prof Kishlansky is a great Professor!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.25","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 81c","course_id":"2355","cat_num":"0296","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 81c","course_id":"2355","cat_num":"0296","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 81c","course_id":"2355","cat_num":"0296","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
