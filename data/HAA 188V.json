He knows so much about Japanese art. He is also very interested in getting to know the students, which is not the case in many of my other courses. I was a complete novice in the field and the region, but I feel like I was able to learn a lot about Buddhism, Japan, and art.","The content was very interesting, and we certainly covered a lot of ground. It was an ambitious syllabus. But I would say that often the good content was frustrated by poor organization or structure. The way PDFs were organized\/labeled on the website made it unclear which readings were due when, and we fell far behind the schedule of the syllabus in our lectures and had to make them up. My biggest problem with the class was the section component. I don't think that discussion-based classes should have sections in the first place (those are for big lectures), but the fact is that in actuality what we had weren't sections\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u201cthey were third classes with their own readings, assignments, and themes, and presenting them as sections was disingenuous; I felt like I'd been tricked into taking a class that had 1.5 times the amount of work of a regular class. The TF seemed knowledgeable about her subject area but pedagogically inexperienced and would often greet student questions or input with long pauses. Expectations for section were sometimes unclear. I also think that in class the professor kind of played favorites."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.00","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"2.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 188V","course_id":"13094","cat_num":"159913","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 188V","course_id":"13094","cat_num":"159913","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
