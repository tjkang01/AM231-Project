He really cares about what students have to say.","This class was amazing. Professor Voorhies is a great person to have a seminar with--he encourages discussion and tries to foster an environment that is comfortable and welcoming to people of all backgrounds and knowledge levels. I came in with little background and absolutely loved the experience. We discussed some amazing and relevant works on contemporary art and art exhibition and then got to actively apply our thoughts and ideas through an open seminar for the public, and got the chance to meet with the artist who we focused on throughout the course. It was incredible and if it gets offered again you must try to take this class.","Conceptually challenging yet made accessible by the instructor prompting curiosity and making everyone feel welcome to the discussion.","This course gives a unique insight into the art world, and encourages an interest and engagement with the practice","This is a tremendous opportunity to work closely with Jim Voorhies and to inhabit the life of the Carpenter Center. If you're interested in curation and contemporary art, this course perfectly runs the line between theory and practice.","This course is heavy on theory and seminar discussion. Multiple papers due every week. Kind and accessible professor for questions, etc. Challenging readings and concepts that are (almost) always followed by seminar to unpack them from a contemporary art point of view. Not much practical application of theory. Great readings. Course is well organized.","I would recommend this course more for undergraduates than graduates."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"5.90","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"15","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 105","course_id":"13478","cat_num":"160218","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 105","course_id":"13478","cat_num":"160218","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
