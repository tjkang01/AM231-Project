Professor Russell is an undisputed expert in this region, and brings a fascinating blend of literary, historical, and political analysis to the texts. The size of the class fostered also facilitated great discussion on the authors and the works they created. This class greatly deepened my understanding of the region and its literary landscape."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"6.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"4","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ARMENST 110B","course_id":"13617","cat_num":"159679","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ARMENST 110B","course_id":"13617","cat_num":"159679","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
