Immensely. Not only did I gain a lot of knowledge, but I also became a much more critical thinker.","Kerry is a phenomenal instructor, very articulate and knowledgable about her field, but also attentive to the needs of her students. This class will challenge many preconceptions about Africa, the West, development, humanitarian efforts, history itself, etc etc. You deal with readings that are sophisticated and jargon-filled but Kerry does an awesome job making them accessible and fitting them into the project of the course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"4.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOC-STD 98OR","course_id":"13068","cat_num":"159817","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOC-STD 98OR","course_id":"13068","cat_num":"159817","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
