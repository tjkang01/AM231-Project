You must be interested in working in foreign languages, though!","Professor Giron is a great, intelligent and helpful teacher. He listens to students and is fun to talk to. He has a gift for languages, so he can be of great help if someone enjoys learning languages.","This is a really great class from an amazing professor.  Highly recommended.","It's an amazing class, with an amazing professor. I'd recommend it for people interested in the middle ages, especially for those who'd like to work with literature outside of western europe. You can put in as much (or as little) work as you want, and the more you put in, the more you can get out of it.","I would tell future students that this class is truly something. Professor Negron is great, and even though the lectures can drag on from time to time, it is really worth attending, and section is a really interesting part of the class, and very much worth it.","The course materials are delightful, yet without some background on the subject, they can be reduced to a literary study of metaphors and techniques which do not answer the question of \"what is mysticism\" save through textual interpretations.","The professor is extremely knowledgeable and inspiring."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Mystics is the most fascinating thing.","see previous answers","Prof. Giron Negron is one of the best instructors at Harvard. This class is the synthesis of his personal intellectual committment to the subject matter and research. I definitely suggest one take this course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"7","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPLIT 211","course_id":"544","cat_num":"3867","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPLIT 211","course_id":"544","cat_num":"3867","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPLIT 211","course_id":"544","cat_num":"3867","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
