You will learn how everything works (or, at least, how a bunch of professors from over the past 60 years think everything works).  It may be like drinking from a fire hose, but you will emerge being able to say something about everything in American Politics.","This is a very useful way to gain exposure to the key pieces of literature that are critical within the field of political science.  This seminar is designed for individuals who have a genuine interest to be exposed to this literature and take initiative in the learning process. Individuals who are expecting any sort of hand-holding or lectures on this material may find it frustrating or more difficult to learn the key concepts and theories.  Alternatively, if you dislike talking in class, this is not the course for you as each person is expected to contribute. Weekly meetings are true to the seminar design (e.g. no lectures, just discussion).  There is a lot of reading on a weekly basis, thus it may be wise to balance this with courses that are not as reading intensive. Feedback is not always pro-actively given but always available upon request.","I wish I would have taken this course at the same time as GOV2000.  I would have been much more comfortable with the theoretical plane on which GOV2000 operated if I was reading about studies by real, live social scientists at the same time."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["The reading load is quite heavy but to be expected given the material covered.
