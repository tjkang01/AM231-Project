Reading can be a bit intensive at times especially since it's in French","Professor Kim is wonderful! Take any class she teaches, and you won't regret it.","This was a great course if you are interested in Science Fiction.","This class was the best French class I've taken at Harvard. Professor Kim is so smart, thoughtful, and interested in students learning. Somehow she managed to facilitate deep philosophical debates in French that all members of the class felt comfortable participating in. The class is also very flexible on deadlines -- you basically have until the last week of the semester before any significant work is due (although you will definitely be doing work before then to keep up with reading and participate in discussions).","Pretty easy, manageable course. Decently interesting."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"9","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
