The laboratories are most useful for students who are already familiar with the transmission electron microscope.","The reservations I have regarding this course: not well organized this year, the lab was a bit more advanced than the lecture--a lot of materials science involved.","This is an excellent course but you need to have a sound background in physics with some knowledge in biological science.","This course would be recommended if the teaching fellow is responsive and the instructor is more engaged. The assistant (Ellen Hodge) is very nice, she is majored in biology, students need biology operation could consider to take this section.","Avoid this course like the plague, or if you must take it, skip lecture and be sure to get the lab section later in the week (when they know what they're doing and have the bugs worked out)."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["a hands-on opportunity to learn cutting edge microscopy with a world leader in the field...for course credit!","It would be nice to learn the basics of TEM and the lab classes are really interesting"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["need a lot of outside of class lab practice and reading.","Please be hard working even the teacher does not require that.","Learned a ton in this class.
