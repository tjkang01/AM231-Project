His class had a lovely atmosphere and covered a lot of interesting topics. However, it lacks structure and the lack of assignments actually proved detrimental- there is no incentive to learn anything, and I always felt like I wanted to be more engaged than I was. Random assignments are occasionally set, but have no due date, don't align with course material, there is very little help to complete them, and they ask things that I simply did not know how to complete. I think there is the potential to have a really good Geophysics course at Harvard, but this is sadly not it. There is no section and no application for the material.","Good class.
