Furthermore, its emphasis on independent research and writing is especially promising for students seeking preparation for a more intensive humanistic or social scientific course of study.","Dominated by graduate students, may be difficult to keep up as an undergrad unfamiliar with the material.","Be prepared for some reasonably high level discussion, and be prepared to contribute.","This was an odd one.  Owen is definitely interesting, but talks a lot and slowly.  Also, it would probably be useful to go to his office hours.  Also, I think he is probably retiring soon or something, but if he does teach more, definitely go to office hours and such.  Also this course ignores Israel-Palestine.  Also, start the paper early!","Professor Owen is a star, and he is very enlightening. This course seems targeted largely at graduate students, and you can expect that it will feel a little unstructured at times.","Great opportunity to study with great professor, but paper is long and rather difficult","Professor is great, very knowledgeable.  Would consider taking another class with him"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"4.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.60","enrollment":"14","response rate":"92.86","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1997","course_id":"12775","cat_num":"89649","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"5","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1997","course_id":"12775","cat_num":"89649","1s":"0","2s":"9","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
