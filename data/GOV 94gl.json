The research paper is an excellent opportunity to delve into a subject that you're interested in.","This seminar provides an excellent overview of human rights and in particular, crimes against humanity. The readings and assignments are interesting, comprehensive, and manageable, which allow really engaging with the material week by week. I would definitely recommend this course to students who are interested in the topic.","Professor Welch is a kind, engaging and incredibly helpful professor. I think that the support and feedback I got on my final paper was the best that I have received in three years at Harvard. I can't recommend this class highly enough.","Take this class to get to know Professor Welch if you don't have any other reason! She's funny and approachable, and makes the conversations about human rights and inhuman wrongs very thought-provoking.","Take this class only if you are willing to put yourself to work. The professor will introduce you to some pretty heavy stuff and unfortunately, the class grades are split in such a way that your final 25 page paper counts for pretty much everything. You don't want that. It is interesting and engaging though and should take if you like small classes with lots of open ended questions."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.17","difficulty":"3.17","recommendation":"4.33","enrollment":"12","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 94gl","course_id":"2169","cat_num":"5106","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 94gl","course_id":"2169","cat_num":"5106","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"10","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 94gl","course_id":"2169","cat_num":"5106","1s":"0","2s":"10","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
