Please take at least one such course during your time at Harvard.","I really hope this course gets offered again! I have never felt so much progress in a single semester in arabic as I did this semester. A lot of that is probably work I put in out of class but this class was very motivating in wanting to put that work in as well, as the workload wasn't extremely high. I think a lot of people at my level (and higher levels) of arabic would really benefit!"]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["If you have the chance to do an independent study (or take any other class) with Irit, I enthusiastically recommend it. She is a brilliant and patient and encouraging teacher and both my language abilities and interest in Hebrew literature grew tremendously this semester. It was such a privilege to get to take this independent study class with Irit!","Irit is a great instructor and conversationalist."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"6.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"NEC 91R","course_id":"3856","cat_num":"110258","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"NEC 91R","course_id":"3856","cat_num":"110258","1s":"3","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
