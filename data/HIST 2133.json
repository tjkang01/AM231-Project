He expects hard work, and will challenge your ideas - but this is, in my experience, something that Harvard could do with much more of. His class made me reconsider my attitude and relationship to History, and I learnt a huge amount on the period. I would recommend his class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"1","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 2133","course_id":"2471","cat_num":"1428","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 2133","course_id":"2471","cat_num":"1428","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 2133","course_id":"2471","cat_num":"1428","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
