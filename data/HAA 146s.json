Class travel is well-organized and a pleasant experience. If you have the chance to take a course such as this, take advantage of it.","If you do not have basic Biblical knowledge this course will be hard. It is also good to know some basic art history and visual analysis. Professor Hamburger does a great job of facilitating discussions and taking into account what students say. You will learn a lot about medieval art and how to conduct a strong formal analysis.","see above","This is by far the BEST class that I've taken at Harvard. Whether or not you are an HAA concentrator, this class will not only teach you about medieval art, but it teaches you how to look at and analyze images.","TAKE IT!","This class is a lot of work but very worth it if you are interested in the material"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"2.90","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"13","response rate":"76.92","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 146s","course_id":"10973","cat_num":"81522","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 146s","course_id":"10973","cat_num":"81522","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 146s","course_id":"10973","cat_num":"81522","1s":"1","2s":"6","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
