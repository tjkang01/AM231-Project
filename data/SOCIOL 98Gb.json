I learned some interesting things, and the workload was moderate.","This class covers really interesting topics and all of the readings are enjoyable. The assignments aren't tedious because they are helping you work toward you final research paper, which is entirely data-based. If you don't like quantitative analysis don't take this class. That being said, Margaret is really accessible and willing to help you out if you are entirely lost with your analysis (like I was).","Choose a research question thoughtfully and early; make sure you are interested in it and the data you will need exists.","I would say that the Professor really wants you to do well-- she is approachable and supportive but you often have to initiate.  Also, she is doing really cool stuff so if you are interested in the topic you should definitely take it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.83","workload":"1.67","difficulty":"2.83","recommendation":"3.67","enrollment":"9","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOCIOL 98Gb","course_id":"5329","cat_num":"86469","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOCIOL 98Gb","course_id":"5329","cat_num":"86469","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOCIOL 98Gb","course_id":"5329","cat_num":"86469","1s":"2","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
