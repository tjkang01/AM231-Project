Prof. Brown and Ben are there to support you and really want to see what you mind can produce! Additionally, the reading can sometimes be a lot (usually) but it is so worth it and the more you do, the more awesome the course will be.","This is a great course which will provide you with invaluable digital humanities skills along with the expected knowledge about the subject matter.","The class is great, but the assignments are hard and time-consuming. I definitely think it's worth it, but I would definitely only take it during a semester when you really have the time","Stay on top of readings! Great class, but readings and projects can sneak up on you if you don't plan accordingly."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.90","difficulty":"3.40","recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1412","course_id":"10931","cat_num":"9564","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1412","course_id":"10931","cat_num":"9564","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1412","course_id":"10931","cat_num":"9564","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
