Neil Shephard is a god of this subject, and 2146 covers key topics that you won't see anywhere else at Harvard. 2014-15 was the first year in a new format, and I'm sure the course will benefit from some debugging for next time.","An incredible class to learn about a huge array of extremely useful topics, from stochastic calculus to Bayesian simulation methods to time series inference methods to all the latest research on volatility. Neil is a great lecturer and knows his stuff, and the assignments were all extremely interesting and helpful for understanding. If interested in quantitative finance or cool statistics, with a good background in probability and statistical computing, you should definitely take this course.","You'll learn a lot of interesting techniques, although it's not clear how applicable they will be to most economists' research. It's very difficult to keep up with the statistics students.","Prof. Shephard is pretty amazing. It really shows he has done a ton of research in volatility, etc, and is really cool to hear him mention connections to current research. The assignments were pretty good, although I rarely had the time\/courage to dive into the optional open-ended researchy questions, although I imagine I would have if I were a grad student. Solidly taught, really informative."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"12.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"15","response rate":"86.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 2146","course_id":"1039","cat_num":"8715","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 2146","course_id":"1039","cat_num":"8715","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 2146","course_id":"1039","cat_num":"8715","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
