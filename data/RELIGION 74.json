Very engaging, very worthwhile, a thoroughly grand experience.","It was awesome! I learned so much about Buddhism. Charlie and Professor Eckel were great. If you have any interest in religion, it would be great for you. Even if you don't, it's still a great option. The class flew by and I'm going to miss having it. The work is more than manageable, also.","This was an amazing class with Professor Eckel and TF Charlie Carstens. The class was small and conducive to a strong introduction to Buddhism. If it is the same teaching staff, I would recommend this class with enthusiasm. But from what I understand, this was a one time thing. In previous and subsequent years it is a gen ed with Janet Gyatso, a course with a different format but a nearly identical syllabus. Given that I think the format of the course, not the syllabus, is the strength of the class I took, I can't say much about Gyatso's class.","Best class I've taken at Harvard."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"4.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 74","course_id":"13028","cat_num":"159733","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 74","course_id":"13028","cat_num":"159733","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
