This course comes highly recommended!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["There is a temptation to drift through the material, but if taken seriously, this is an incredibly rich class. This course lays out an intellectual reconstruction of an idea through time in a way that is rarely attempted in academia anymore. This is perhaps because this type of exercise requires a much greater amount of historical, philosophical, and historical knowledge than almost other courses, which will inherently be more focused in some way. It would take someone with Professor Riley's encyclopedic knowledge of philosophy and literature to teach a course like this. I have yet to encounter such a person, and honestly do not believe that s\/he exists."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.25","enrollment":"9","response rate":"55.56","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 2097","course_id":"2263","cat_num":"52088","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 2097","course_id":"2263","cat_num":"52088","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 2097","course_id":"2263","cat_num":"52088","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
