Prof. Kim led fun and fascinating discussions about the contemporary novel.","A great survey of the novel in France following the New Novel movement. The course always hinged on the pressing questions facing what the novel can, or must do, up to the contemporary era.","I highly recommend taking any class with Prof. Kim! She runs her classes like a discussion seminar, so you get lots of speaking practice. She does a great job of accommodating everyone's different levels, so don't worry if you have a lower level of French than other students in the class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"8.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
