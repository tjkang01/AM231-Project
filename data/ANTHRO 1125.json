It doesn't require a lot of work, but th two exams and final paper make sure that one does walk away with increased knowledge.","This course is really fun and interesting!","One of the best classes I have taken at Harvard.","I came in knowing nothing about the Moche and left with much more than new understanding of a different culture.","It's a great option for Lit B-- not that difficult, extremely interesting, and an engaging professor.","Pick a pot which people took time to actually discuss or else the term paper will be difficult!","plan ahead for the final paper: pick a topic and know what sort of a pot you need for that.","It's a great class to take. While it's not extremely rigorous, you do have to pay attention to pass and it's extremely enjoyable. I would take any class that Professor Quilter teaches, he's outstanding. He could make the the life of a snail sound interesting and worthwhile.","The professor is kind of goofy, so if you can dig his teaching style, you will dig this class.","You should be interested in iconography and archaeology.","It's a fun gen ed course.","very interesting look into an unheard of culture.  lots of fun and you'll actually learn a lot.  be prepared for the questioning looks of others when you tell you what classes you're taking though","Split the readings with a few friends, and each of you take notes.","Great professor, great class, I have told my academic advisor to recommend it to other students as a great way to fulfill the Lit-B requirement."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.36","workload":"1.64","difficulty":"2.50","recommendation":"4.73","enrollment":"25","response rate":"88.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 1125","course_id":"131","cat_num":"0593","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"10","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 1125","course_id":"131","cat_num":"0593","1s":"3","2s":"5","3s":"14","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 1125","course_id":"131","cat_num":"0593","1s":"9","2s":"12","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
