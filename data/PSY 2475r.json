I would highly recommend it!","Everyone in the lab is chill","The actual focus of the lab is very interesting; the lab itself is new and rather unstructured, still in the works. Very hands-off in terms of assignments given in the lab. Allows a lot of flexibility in terms of project undertaken in lab \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you have some leverage in what project you want to participate in, as an assistant or thesis researcher. Josh knows his stuff, very clear explainer of concepts. Very busy, not very accessible, unfortunately \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a big let-down. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see very little of him throughout the semester, except at lab meetings. Lab meetings once weekly are helpful in getting an idea of what else is going on in lab. Hayley, the lab organizer, is sweet and flexible; if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come in, let her know in advance.\r\nRequires 10-15 hours in lab per week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you have to be physically present, which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel very useful when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing a project which is computer-based. (Perhaps you could get more done at home.) I guess this is what research assistants are supposed to be, but we really were more like mice-servants than project leaders much of the time. There are a lot of us, and a lot of data input, and little explanation as to the overall scope and purpose of our work. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing a group project and someone slacks (because people aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t kept accountable), you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pick up their work."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This is a great lab course.
