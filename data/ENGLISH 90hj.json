Since he is unquestionably one of the great modern novelists, it is helpful that the broad syllabus gives you a solid understanding of what he's working for in his writing. While the reading for the week was, therefore, considerable (expect avg 300 pages), it was on the whole doable and enormously rewarding. And then the professor is really unique. Elisa New is very warm and has a great sense of humor, and she also really cares about her students. As a teacher she is consistently eloquent and often enlightening, if at times rambling. An inspiring figure.","This is a high quality in depth introduction to a (the?) key American writer of the turn of the century. Vital for understanding the transition from realism to modernism.","This class was a really great experience and I would recommend it eagerly to anyone passionate about English!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.25","workload":"3.50","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 90hj","course_id":"1499","cat_num":"35457","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 90hj","course_id":"1499","cat_num":"35457","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 90hj","course_id":"1499","cat_num":"35457","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
