Professor Georganteli is a wonderful, wonderful professor (and an all-around amazing person) who always gave rich, engaging lectures. She always made herself available to her students and always encouraged her students to stop by her office to ask questions, clear up concepts, etc.  Some of my favorite moments of the semester was the time spent during office hours. It was clear she cared about the successes of her students and always expressed interest in their academic and extracurricular pursuits. What made the class a particularly great experience was having the opportunity to handle coins almost each week. In the end, I learned so much-it will be hard for other courses to compete with the stature of this course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.33","difficulty":"3.33","recommendation":"4.33","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 142v","course_id":"2564","cat_num":"50437","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 142v","course_id":"2564","cat_num":"50437","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 142v","course_id":"2564","cat_num":"50437","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
