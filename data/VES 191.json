The films are not always enjoyable but always thought-provoking and intriguing. Each of them has challenged me to rethink what I consider to be the norms of filmmaking.","Dennis Lim is an amazing curator who puts a lot of effort into the syllabus. The films are great and the readings useful for any future film course. The lectures are loosely structured and discussion based, which can be difficult at times, but I prefer this style of class. Occasionally Dennis will invite a director to come to class, and it's nice to see how the theories apply to the real world. Becca is also incredibly helpful and knowledgable!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"6.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"57.14","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
