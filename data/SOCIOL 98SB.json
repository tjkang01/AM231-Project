Class discussion is engaging and challenging but Prof. Sosnaud also makes it a relaxed, low-stress environment despite the high amount of engagement and work required.","This was a great course. The subject matter is extremely interesting and relevant. Leaving this class I feel like I can contribute to the field and help address some of the issues mentioned. At the very least I feel more informed and as if I can conduct my own research that may supplement the existing literature. This course really prepared me to write a junior paper and the things I learned in this course will prepare me for any major paper I may write in the future. Also Professor Sosnaud is the most encouraging teacher and really cares about helping each student along in the process of writing a junior paper.","Great class if you're interested in health; you design your own sociology research project on any health topic which is cool and helpful when possibly thinking about a thesis","This is a great class to take if you are interested in the social side of health.  It is also really cool to do a quantitive project.  You get to utilize a lot of the skills you learn in a stat class and apply them to something in the real world."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
