It's obvious that Brendan put a lot of thought into the course in terms of lecture material and readings. I learned a lot about the field of cancer metabolism!","As a cancer biologist, it's critical to have some understanding of tumor metabolism.  This course is a great introduction to the field.","This course provided an outstanding introduction to the basic and complex principles of tumor cell signaling and metabolism. The lectures were phenomenal and will serve as a compendium that I will reference far into the future.","A great course which will challenge you","This was one of the best classes I have taken in graduate school. Dr. Manning facilitated excellent discussion; the lectures were great preparation for the readings and a nice introduction to the field.","The best course that I took this semester!
