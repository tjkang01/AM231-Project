The readings are fascinating - stuff that you would never find on your own but which is really illuminating. Discussions can be unhelpful though, especially when only a fraction of the class has a history of science background.","Steven Shapin is a legend and ran the course in a particular way; future instructors will likely bring something quite different to the table"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["A useful survey\/ background of the field of the history of science and important turning points in historiography.","This is a phenomenal course that all history of science grad students should take. It complements other courses really well, reaching back much further than most do to illustrate important developments in the field. The readings are diverse and incredibly illuminating about how science has been thought about over the last 100+ years.
