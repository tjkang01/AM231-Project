It's not a class to take lightly or for fun.","You will need to be self-motivated and a little entrepreneurial about getting conversation practice.","Persian is a difficult by rewarding language. I think this course does a good job of helping students develop skills in listening, speaking, and writing, and builds on other skills in Persian."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["If you are taking this class for fun (not for a requirement), I recommend you audit. Only because the grading is clear but also strict, and it'll likely bring down your GPA. If you have to take the course, fear not!

She takes a modern innovative approach towards language teaching, which is a Godsend in a world where you can only study Persian through the poetry of Rumi and Hafez."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Sheida is one of the best language instructors I have ever studied with!
