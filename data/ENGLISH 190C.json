The syllabus is really fascinating, and my only complaint was that we sometimes didn't have enough class time to discuss everything we wanted to. Take it if you can!","Take this class. There is really no one like Professor Coriale--she has boundless enthusiasm for the subject, and it really benefits each class's discussion.  One interesting component of the course was that all of the students that took it were pre-med, English concentrators, which made it a refreshing group of students to say the least.  \r\nNot only is Professor Coriale a dynamic teacher, but she is readily available outside of class to talk about essays or non-class related interests and I found in her a real mentor.  She is incredibly approachable and inspiring."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"5.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 190C","course_id":"13350","cat_num":"160947","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 190C","course_id":"13350","cat_num":"160947","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
