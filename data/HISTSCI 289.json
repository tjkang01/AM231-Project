Great course - really interesting material - informs future visits to exhibits and collections at museums, etc.","Many classes aim to balance theory and practice, but this one actually does. The readings are focused around books rather than essays or papers. The writing assignments are useful and interesting. Prof. provides useful feedback on papers. Final is a practical application of theory through the creation of an exhibit which is challenging (lots of students working together on one project), but it is also very fun and rewarding if you are interesting in the chosen topic and exhibit work. If someone is looking for theory around curating or informal learning, this course does not explicitly cover that side of things. One of my favorite courses!","This course was an excellent examination of material culture. The first portion of the semester was broad in scope, with focused portions on diverse topics - blue jeans, coffee, medieval robots - but these themes were all tied together well under the banner of material culture. The experience of working on a museum exhibit as the final project was outstanding, and something I will never forget, and an opportunity I am thankful to have had. If you take this course, you won't regret (or forget) it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"5.90","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HISTSCI 289","course_id":"2703","cat_num":"107818","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HISTSCI 289","course_id":"2703","cat_num":"84196","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HISTSCI 289","course_id":"2703","cat_num":"107818","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
