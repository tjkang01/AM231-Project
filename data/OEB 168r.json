You get to see how they think.","Generous teachers and reasonable workload. You do need to have an interest in the material and be prepared, though!","If you are at all interested in plants and the alternation of generations, you will find this class extremely interesting.  The two professors are one of the best parts of the class.  Ned and David are some of the most intelligent, humorous, and friendly professors I've had here at Harvard, and they alone are a reason you might want to take this class","I loved this course! Professor Haig is my favorite professor at Harvard - his genetic conflict work (and just knowledge base in general) is out of this world amazing. I didn't know Professor Friedman before this course, but grew to love him and his teaching style as well. Phenomenal course. Emphasis on learning the material rather than tedious assignments. Learned a ton. Strongly recommend for people interested in botany. I was not interested in botany but very interested in genetic conflict and loved this course. Definitely recommend as an upper level elective! Two of the best OEB professors here, no question!"]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["Really fun chance to yak with the experts about weird plants and weird theory.
