The minute details of case-work (which at any rate are less interesting than learning about results and techniques and surveying a terrain. \r\n\r\nThe organization of the course, however, was rather poor. I learned more writing the final paper than I did in the other general swatches of the course (which covered very little meaningfully). The course also failed to explain why anyone should care about social choice as a field of economics today (seems like it has faded in importance since the 80s) and whether there is any worthwhile research to be done there. This seems like a basic expectation it should have met.","A great chance to learn a cool topic in economics with great professors.","This isn't a class that develops a general, systematic framework for social choice theory. It presents some select results, discusses a few topics, but these are like bonuses for somebody who is already familiar with the material, or doing a lot of reading outside of class. You won't get much out if you don't put much in. There isn't a whole lot of guidance on the final project, but I didn't find that to be much of a problem.","As a grad course, it requires a substantial commitment to independently following up on the work."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Awesome","Once in a lifetime experience. This is the kind of class that makes Harvard great.","Social choice is a very cool field. It blends economics and philosophy in a really unique way, and you leave the class really feeling like there's a lot of work to be done, both with very heady theory concepts and in practical implementation and empirics."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"10.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"8","response rate":"62.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 2082","course_id":"1029","cat_num":"108965","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 2082","course_id":"1029","cat_num":"50769","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 2082","course_id":"1029","cat_num":"108965","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
