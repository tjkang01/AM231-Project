Also, read about each technique ahead of time since in clas you'll often be thrown into a new topic without a lot of theoretical grounding.","This was a very useful course in terms of introducing you to new techniques you may not have heard before and getting you totally set up to actually run them. It's not in-depth enough on any one technique to allow you a good understanding of it, so be prepared to do work on your own for that. Given the breadth of topics, I'd say it's a better class to audit than to officially take.","know R beforehand.  don't expect to get much technical background on the topics being covered.  this course is for sampling a bunch of cool things and learning how to make them work with R.  learning actually what goes into bayesian statistics, or machine learning, is only covered lightly in this course, and you'll get the most out of it if you think of the course as a way to learn how to do things you've already studied in R.","It is a helpful introduction to R, but shouldn't be taken if one wants to deeply understand the techniques.","Know why you are taking it.  If you are interested in what will be covered, and have some thoughts on how to apply it, this is a great class for you."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"1.90","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"13","response rate":"84.62","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 3490","course_id":"4362","cat_num":"8235","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 3490","course_id":"4362","cat_num":"8235","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"5","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 3490","course_id":"4362","cat_num":"8235","1s":"4","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
