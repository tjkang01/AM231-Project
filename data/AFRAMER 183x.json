It will give you new lenses through which to reflect and act on reality. It will offer you opportunities to do radically innovative things with your education. This class is part of a larger decolonizing project. My life would not have been the same had I not taken this class at this time and I cannot say that about many classroom experiences.","Robin and Emily were both really wonderful teachers and the subject matter for this class is not only fascinating, but essential. It's pretty difficult and it's a lot of reading, but it's reading that you need.","This class will teach you so much, Robin and Emily are amazing discussion facilitators and are truly committed to making queer of color theory accessible and making sure everyone leaves on the same page.","This is an incredible class on a new and exciting field that will have a huge impact across disciplines. You have to take this course. The texts can be difficult, and the discussion challenging, but it will always be interesting and you will learn a lot. This class is not only or even primarily for people who know what queer of color theory, or queer theory are (though you should at least know what \"of color\" means), so if you have no idea what either of those mean but want to learn, you should take this course.","This is a great class, and Robin is one of the best teachers I've had. Just be careful not to think it will be super easy. There is so much reading to do, and a lot of it can be very dense. If you're not already good with theory, and enjoy it, this isn't the class for you.","This class was challenging, fascinating, and very meaningful. I could not encourage you enough to take it.","This is a great concept for a course that, at least this year, drew a lot of super intelligent students who had very edifying things to say. Professor Bernstein is very passionate about the ideas we read about. The readings and discussion topics could have been a little more varied."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.17","recommendation":"4.67","enrollment":"16","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AFRAMER 183x","course_id":"73","cat_num":"58474","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"6","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AFRAMER 183x","course_id":"73","cat_num":"58474","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"10","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AFRAMER 183x","course_id":"73","cat_num":"58474","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
