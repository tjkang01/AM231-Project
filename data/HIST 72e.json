The paper assignments are short and you don't have to work far in advance, but always have them in the back of your mind while doing the readings. You get a relative amount of freedom with topics too.","Prof O'Neill is not only a preeminent scholar of the Russian Empire, but an imaginative and interesting teacher as well. I highly recommend this class, even if its topic or workload seem a bit intimidating - it was definitely worth it!","Amazing class and professor; great discussion environment (but remember to do all the reading so that you can participate usefully)","A close look at one of the most fascinating and mistakenly-maligned monarchs with a truly enthusiastic and knowledgeable professor."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.17","workload":"2.17","difficulty":"2.67","recommendation":"4.33","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 72e","course_id":"2327","cat_num":"9664","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 72e","course_id":"2327","cat_num":"9664","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 72e","course_id":"2327","cat_num":"9664","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
