It does not require the additional time of the intensive course, yet it will get you speaking, reading, and writing Russian faster than you ever thought was possible.  By about halfway through the semester I was able to have basic conversations with native speakers at the language tables.  As long as you are willing to learn and put in a little time every day, the workload is manageable.  The teachers were wonderful and very good at explaining some tricky points of Russian grammar.  Not only do you learn the language, but you also are exposed to great works by Pushkin, songs, films, and cartoons, teaching a lot about Russian culture.  If you want to learn a new language and have a great time doing it, take this class!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"7.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RUSS ATA","course_id":"5328","cat_num":"109273","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RUSS At","course_id":"5328","cat_num":"39963","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RUSS ATA","course_id":"5328","cat_num":"109273","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
