It does not presume any prior knowledge of the region and thus students with strong regional backgrounds may find it elementary. Prof. Colton is an excellent overseer of research.","Will increase your general and area knowledge significantly"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["It is a great chance to learn from other established and up-and-coming scholars, but if you are a Master's or undergraduate student, your voice may drowned out","Despite the unbalanced structure of class readings, the professors who teach this course make it worth the while. Also, the fellows are an added bonus. It's like having 15 professors teaching one class.","This course is a uniquely innovative look at the ongoing legacies of the Soviet Union on its successor states. If you are interested in politics in the post-Soviet space at all, this course is a must-take.","Class discussions and readings are not the main focus of this class. Rather, this course is good for developing your ideas into work that may be publishable in the future. It is also helpful for meeting and networking with leading scholars in the field."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.60","difficulty":"3.10","recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 2887","course_id":"2298","cat_num":"15419","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 2887","course_id":"2298","cat_num":"15419","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 2887","course_id":"2298","cat_num":"15419","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
