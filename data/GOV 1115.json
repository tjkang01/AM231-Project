The material is excellent, really interesting and Professor Ekiert is excellent. He is a great lecturer, spirited and great to talk to. He helped me choose a topic I was very satisfied with for the final paper and helped me develop an argument in a way I had not seen professors do before. With that said, the course does have intense readings; intense in the regards that they are most appreciated if they are closely read (they therefore necessitate a lot of attention). One must also write a 25 page final paper. The course is certainly challenging but I am very happy that I took the course and challenged myself in this particular way."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["This is an extremely interesting and enjoyable class. Professor Ekiert has invaluable advice in helping you think about the final paper and you come away with a fairly systematic and comprehensive understanding of one of the major topics in the social sciences. You won't regret taking this class!","Strongly recommend if you're a undergrads interested in contentions politics"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"7.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 1115","course_id":"11736","cat_num":"127064","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"6","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 1115","course_id":"11736","cat_num":"127064","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
