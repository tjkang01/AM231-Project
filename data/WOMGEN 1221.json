The content is great, the discussions are engaging, and Professor Grigsby is a great professor, who is very helpful and available to help. Her expectations are high, but I always felt supported and driven to meet them.","The material in this course is incredible. To me, thinking about Chicana feminisms means thinking about how race, gender, ethnicity, culture, citizenship, and language all interact with one another. It means thinking actively about all the ways of belonging we use to navigate the world, and it becomes so clear here how impossible and foolish it is to segment them. A lot of the readings are theoretical, and I sometimes would read them out loud to friends just to have a laugh at how strange WGS courses can get. But ultimately, I take them really seriously, and I loved moving through the material here. It certainly bled into all of my other classes, and I think it's going to stick with me for a long time.","Be prepared to read, a lot. The professor will call you out, even if you try to avoid eye contact.","I think the class was challenging at times but it was truly one of the best classes I've taken. It helped me enhance my critical thinking skills and my writing a great deal. Also, Professor Grigsby is very passionate about the material and is very knowledgable about it, which helps when dissecting topics and theories. She is also very creative in teaching us the material and allows discussion to be a tool for our learning","I learned a lot from this class.  It is definitely a lot of work, but it was worth it. I recommend taking it, but not if you're looking for an easy fifth class or not intending to do all the readings. If you put in the work and are interested in social justice, race, ethnicity, feminism, and\/or Chicanx\/Latinx history and studies, then definitely check out this course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"6.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"11","response rate":"54.55","QCourseOverall":{"number":"WOMGEN 1221","course_id":"12663","cat_num":"56336","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"WOMGEN 1221","course_id":"12663","cat_num":"56336","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
