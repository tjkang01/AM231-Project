'07":{"comments":["knowledge about matlab is necessary for homework."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["This class is a lot like ES273, but with more emphasis on simulation and numerical methods. (This may have changed)","Very demanding class but a lot to learn at the end."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["This course has the potential of being very helpful to your research. It's a nice overview of  the field of nanophotonics and forces you to understand some of the fundamentals through various simulations.","ES275 covers a sizable amount of material relevant to current research; realize also that it has a significant simulation component (e.g. involving Matlab)."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["The class is very well organized. You get slides from each lecture. The topics are similar to ES273 (Loncar) but taught in a very different way. The focus of this class is more FDTD, dipole approximations, and nanoparticles whereas ES273 is more focused on waveguides, dispersion and photonic devices. Both touch on metamaterials, plasmonics. Homeworks for ES275 take awhile and you need to understand matlab to be able to do them.","This course is a great way to become familiar with FDTD techniques.  The lecture notes are available as printed packets before each lecture and the course in general is very well organized.  There are weekly problem sets but for the most part they are not as bad as a lot of other graduate level courses.  Problem sets 2 and 3 are the longest and most confusing -- don't be discouraged if you find them difficult but start them early and seek help from Prof. Crozier or from the TF when you get stuck on them.  The unofficial TF, Dongxing Wang, was very helpful, and Prof. Crozier was also very helpful in office hours.  Make sure you have thought about other coordinate systems before the midterm exam.  Start your final project early because it will take longer to complete than you expect."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.90","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"2.90","recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"17","response rate":"94.12","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENG-SCI 275","course_id":"1395","cat_num":"9815","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"8","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENG-SCI 275","course_id":"1395","cat_num":"9815","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"11","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENG-SCI 275","course_id":"1395","cat_num":"9815","1s":"0","2s":"9","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
