Liz has high standards, but she creates such a supportive classroom environment. Since this course requires that students do a research project using primary source materials, I recommend exploring potential topics before the semester begins. In addition, start the various assignments early so you can take advantage of the feedback from Liz and the other students. The course will provide you with the guidance and time to do a research paper, and it also gives you a chance to get to learn more about the research interests of other students.","Class is a requirement but a very enjoyable one!","This is the only time you will have time truly devoted to writing and researching."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"9.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"16","response rate":"56.25","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
