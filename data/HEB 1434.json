Stephanie is an amazing mentor and helped us through every step of the process of conducting a behavioral study, from formulating our ideas, designing the study, collecting and analyzing data, and writing a paper. We spent 4 weeks (~6 hours\/week) at the zoo collecting data, which was challenging at first, but we soon got the hang of it and I really looked forward to my zoo day every week. Since this was the first time the course was offered, we were definitely the \"guinea pigs,\" but part of the fun was troubleshooting the problems that came up along the way. We each got so much one-on-one attention from Stephanie during our weekly classes (which were sort of like check-ins to see how our projects were going and to share our projects and ask questions). I would highly recommend this course, especially to people who enjoyed HEB 1330 (Primate Social Behavior) or are interested in field work.","This was by far one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. It was rewarding, fun, and applicable to my summer research. I loved going to the zoo every week. It became my conversation piece all the time. The class was not easy, but the work I did, I wanted to do. The more you put in, the more you get out of it. If you have the time and the ability, you should take this course."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This is one of the best course you can take in Harvard. First, you get a free membership in the Franklin Park Zoo, and you get to go there a multiple times to collect observational data. If you don't have much research background or experience, this is the great course to make your own hypothesis of interest, actually go to the zoo to collect behavioral data, use statistical analysis to test your hypothesis, and write a research paper and make a poster as well."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"1","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HEB 1434","course_id":"11492","cat_num":"19021","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HEB 1434","course_id":"11492","cat_num":"19021","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HEB 1434","course_id":"11492","cat_num":"19021","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
