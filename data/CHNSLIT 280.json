She provides wonderful feedback on all the writing that you do in the course, and is very supportive of creative interests. If you're interested at all in Chinese literature and\/or the histories of Beijing and Shanghai, absolutely take this course! All of the readings are very interesting.","Take it, and don't be limited to orthodox modes when composing weekly responses or a final paper; Prof. Li is very open to creative modes of doing assignments, so take advantage of this opportunity."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["This class could serve multiple purposes: a historical background on modern China through the humanistic lenses that focus on its 2 major cities, a introduction to Chinese film and literature, and\/or a platform for the discussion of modernity in a Chinese context. Regardless of what students' interests are, the structure and teaching of the course compels active engagement from students and guarantees that they will get something worthwhile out of it.","Great class, you learn a lot about Chinese history and literature. Love the inter-medial aspect of the course. Professor Li is AWESOME and every single reading\/film\/activity\/assignment is fun.","Great class with a great professor. More of a humanities class than anything else. The 5 responses that I wrote were more work than I thought, but the class gave me a lot of independence to think about ideas I was interested in."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"7.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHNSLIT 280","course_id":"10697","cat_num":"109512","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHNSLIT 280","course_id":"10697","cat_num":"78971","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"8","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHNSLIT 280","course_id":"10697","cat_num":"109512","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
