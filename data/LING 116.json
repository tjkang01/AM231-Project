I was surprised how much mathematical formalism underlies the field of semantics, so I suspect that this class would be most interesting to those with at least a basic mathematical background.","If you think yourself a Semantics-savvy, you will enjoy learning more about various topics with a knowledgeable semanticist."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Go to office hours.","It's a great start into Semantics.","Take it! Especially if you like the idea of thinking about language in a mathematical way. It'll astonish you how mathematical language is and the problem sets are also really fun to solve, though challenging!"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Semantics is amazing, so you should take it for that reason alone.  It will completely change the way you think about language. Gennaro is a wonderful teacher, who genuinely cares about his students.  That said, you will find things immensely easier if you have some rudimentary knowledge of logic going into the class.","This class is very useful if you want to know how to do semantics. Vivid examples and intriguing instructions are given."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["You really ought to have taken a previous semantics course in order to understand this class.","This is a great semantics course. Gennaro is an engaging lecturer and he really, really cares about his students. Sections are extremely helpful and well-planned out, especially if Dorothy is a TF again next year. Some semantics background is helpful, but everything is gone over slowly and thoughtfully by Gennaro. The assignments are straightforward, and grading is transparent. Overall, one of the best linguistics courses I've taken!","Be sure to make your own notes from the start as well as go over the handouts several times to consolidate understanding. Going back to the handouts weeks later is very difficult without additional material to back up recollection of the material."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"6.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LING 116","course_id":"2791","cat_num":"122515","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LING 116","course_id":"2791","cat_num":"2118","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LING 116","course_id":"2791","cat_num":"122515","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
