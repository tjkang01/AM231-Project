The material is difficult, but the way the class is structured and Professor Hueckmann make it worth it.  Through this class you gain a pretty awesome understanding of German culture and literature, and your language skills will improve exponentially.","Overall a fantastic class. Dania is fantastic, the assignments are challenging but worthwhile, and you will really see yourself grow as a German reader and writer.","If you're interested in German literature or want to improve your German, definitely take this class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GERMAN 101","course_id":"13280","cat_num":"159603","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"GERMAN 101","course_id":"13280","cat_num":"159603","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
