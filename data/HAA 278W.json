He's passionate and encourages discussions among the students. He also will push back and is willing to be pushed back. It's obvious that he cares a lot about both the students and the topic, and it'll be an incredible experience.","Benjamin is a fabulous teacher - he's extremely generous and fostered some of the most generative conversations I've had as a graduate student here at Harvard. I would recommend taking any course with him, though, I have to say, this one was particularly phenomenal."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"8.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"11","response rate":"54.55","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 278W","course_id":"13747","cat_num":"160002","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 278W","course_id":"13747","cat_num":"160002","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
