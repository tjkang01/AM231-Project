It's an interesting mix of genres and mediums. It was awesome to see how a genre that is often considered just an opportunity for cheap thrills is actually and important literary and cultural argument.","This was a great class, and if the topic interests you, absolutely take it! This was my favorite course at Harvard, and the syllabus is well-designed so that the work is informative and thought-provoking, but also enjoyable.","This class gives a very good overview of the genre of detective literature as a whole, setting it in its proper historical context. But remember that it's a history and literature course, meaning that there will be a good amount of history covered as part of it. It's not all reading detective literature itself. As long as you have an interest in both areas, or an interest in understanding literary topics in the settings in which they originate, you'll enjoy this class immensely. And you get to watch Sherlock, so what's not to love?"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"4.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"15","response rate":"53.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90bi","course_id":"12768","cat_num":"44123","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90bi","course_id":"12768","cat_num":"44123","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
