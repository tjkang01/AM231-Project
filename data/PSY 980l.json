Mariko is a fantastic teacher.","This is a really interesting class which relates to a number of other areas of psychology.  Even if you are not specifically interested in language, this class touches a number of different areas including conceptual development and theory of mind.  The small class size and supportive seminar leader this year really allowed us to delve into each topic.  Overall a great class!"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This class is highly data and methodology focused, and individuals should be aware before taking it that details of experimentation and methodologies are much more likely to be discussed that big-picture themes or applications. If you are uncomfortable or unfamiliar with laboratory methods and critical data analysis and are merely curious about the interaction of language and though, this class is not the best choice for you. You also must be familiar with the psychological writing style in order to succeed in this course.","I think I came into the course with more of a \"pop psychology\" interest in the topic, and I wasn't prepared for such a heavy cognitive psych class. This class has a small time commitment and relatively short readings, but that doesn't mean it's easy. While the topic of language and thought has a lot of interesting research, be prepared for some difficult research papers. Section is fantastic though, and Mariko is an excellent professor!","It's definitely tough, but you learn A LOT.","I loved this class. Class was always engaging and thought-provoking. Mariko is a fantastic professor. The class has an entirely reasonable workload but is surprisingly difficult. Be proactive about seeking advice and criticism before handing in assignments, which are graded pretty harshly. That said, I'd definitely choose to take the class again."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.83","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.83","recommendation":"3.33","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 980l","course_id":"4241","cat_num":"37547","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 980l","course_id":"4241","cat_num":"37547","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 980l","course_id":"4241","cat_num":"37547","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
