Do the readings because they really aid to class discussion. If you don't read then class is more or less pointless. Readings can take a lot of hours so start ahead.","You read a book every week so make sure you are able to plan your time accordingly. Also make sure you get a copy of the books well ahead of time. I didn't want to buy all of the books, because there are so many, but these books are mostly unknown and very hard to locate. Make sure you have  a copy of the book at the beginning of each week so you have time to read it and write a response by the end of the week.","If you want to get a better understanding of Modern India, then this will be the best selection of readings from some of the best novels and short stories you'll ever find."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"7.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SAS 199","course_id":"12651","cat_num":"78436","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"SAS 199","course_id":"12651","cat_num":"78436","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
