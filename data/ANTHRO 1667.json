I would also highly recommend students to take up courses offered by the instructor for her pedagogy is extremely inspiring for an aspiring scholar, as well as a conscious citizen.","This class will really get you thinking about a number of social and political issues in much broader context than just the continent of Africa, although you will gain a lot of specific historic and cultural insight into various African regions.","This was a great class! It really helped me to think differently about \"modernization\" and \"development\" in the African context. You may look at the syllabus and think witchcraft is random -- it's really connected to the material. And Kerry is great! What makes classes really good are the discussions that happen. Engage with the course and you'll love it! And it's minimal work - took me 1 hour to do the readings every week :)"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"2.73","recommendation":"3.91","enrollment":"12","response rate":"91.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 1667","course_id":"155","cat_num":"25018","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 1667","course_id":"155","cat_num":"25018","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 1667","course_id":"155","cat_num":"25018","1s":"1","2s":"9","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
