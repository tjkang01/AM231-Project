There was also a ton of freedom in the topics I could research for the lab, but I was given advice whenever I asked for it."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["If you have the opportunity to work in the Banaji lab, you should absolutely take it. Olivia is incredible - brilliant, supportive, accessible, and understanding, she'll push you to think more deeply both about your own work and issues in social psychology and the world. The lab's research is fascinating and it's really a privilege to learn about and contribute to it.","I worked with Olivia and she was awesome! The project we were working on allowed us to pick what kind of work we were most interested in, so it was really great to get to explore personal interests within the context of a larger project. It felt wonderful to work on something that could have \"real-life\" impact."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"9.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"5","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 1556r","course_id":"4274","cat_num":"78884","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 1556r","course_id":"4274","cat_num":"78884","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 1556r","course_id":"4274","cat_num":"78884","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
