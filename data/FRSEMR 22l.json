The classes dragged on. I tried to like it, but unfortunately came to dread the class's meeting each week. I would take a class on this topic again if the format were changed and discussion was promoted more. Some complex philosophical ideas were presented in the readings. It would have been great to discuss them more in class, rather than having short definitions told to us in lectures. I felt like I was taking notes for something to do rather than because the notes were necessary.","This course is a great to balance with harder courses. But don't underestimate the amount you will learn--you actually learn quite a lot.","Heavy reading, but if you do it, it is worth it for the most part. Great to learn more about ethics.","Overall, It's a great class if you're genuinely into justice and policy issues in health. Be prepared to read a lot.","This class is good for those interested in philosophy. It focuses a lot on moral philosophy"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.20","workload":"3.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.20","enrollment":"8","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 22l","course_id":"12355","cat_num":"10823","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 22l","course_id":"12355","cat_num":"10823","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
