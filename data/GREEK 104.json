Take this course if you are seeking to gain an in-depth knowledge of one of the most important Greek authors, his program, style, and goals, and to improve your Greek along the way.","When Yvona Trnka-Amrhein taught this class, it was excellent: she has an astonishing command of the text, and is well-versed in the secondary literature as well. She's really invested in students understanding the Greek, but also in them developing their own interpretative ideas about the text. The length of the readings is very manageable, but be prepared for a LOT of vocabulary you don't know yet - Herodotus can get pretty technical sometimes. Set aside time just to study the vocab - otherwise you may find yourself in a state of \u00e1\u00bc\u20ac\u00cf\u20ac\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0081\u00ce\u00af\u00ce\u00b1 on an exam, even when you've gone over a text before.","This class, as taught by Prof. Henrichs and Yvona Trnka-Amrhein, was absolutely amazing beyond words. A great class, well taught, and even a lot of fun! Frankly I looked forward to coming into class every day. Definitely take this if you're thinking about it.","This is a great class if you love greek historians.","Fantastic course! People around the world will miss Professor Henrichs. He was a wonderful man. Thank you, sir.","This was a great class!! I feel that my Greek got better and I learned a lot about Herodotus. I'd highly recommend this class!!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"7.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"8","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
