Assignments take a long time each week, and attention to detail is essential.","My only reservation is time. This course with its intense and numerous homeworks and projects was in my experience comparable only to Physics 16 in time consumption (but do not be unduly deterred - it is of course possible that it might be a bit different the next time the course is given). However, I have undergone a great change in this course: I had very little idea of what programming even was, and now I feel confident about writing a program to do a task I can understand."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"4.50","difficulty":"4.00","recommendation":"3.50","enrollment":"3","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"E-PSCI 100","course_id":"668","cat_num":"0235","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"E-PSCI 100","course_id":"668","cat_num":"0235","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"E-PSCI 100","course_id":"668","cat_num":"0235","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
