Without all of these things, it could be very frustrating for students.","great breadth, not too much depth.  somewhat frustrating discussions, too many readings, a bit too much interdisc. appeal, that makes cohesive discussion a challenge. better to take if enrollment is a bit lower.","HEAVY work load.  You'll feel like you're grabbing for something to hold onto....","This course has more reading than you could imagine and features works by many writers (e.g. Lacan) who could fill an entire course on their own.  That said, it was one of the more rewarding experiences I have had at Harvard.  Unlike many classes, where hard preparation --> flat and um.. surface-level theoretical discussions, B. Good and the other students were always ready to engage my opinions on a rigorous and complex level.  If you are at all interested in anthropology or social theory, I'd say this is a must-take course.","The workload was onerous at times and I felt the class lacked cohesion."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["The discussions are what you make of them.
