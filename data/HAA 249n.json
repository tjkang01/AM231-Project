Reading entire works is really essential, but that doesn't leave much time to read anything else, including critiques of the works.  I think that it's really important that more emphasis is placed on discussing how to effectively use travel narratives as primary sources."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Interesting readings, useful class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.25","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.33","recommendation":"4.75","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 249n","course_id":"2603","cat_num":"74089","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 249n","course_id":"2603","cat_num":"74089","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 249n","course_id":"2603","cat_num":"74089","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
