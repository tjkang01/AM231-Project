So it's up to you to make it a worthy class.","This class will teach you a lot about the Greeks and Romans in relation to peoples that coexisted with them in the same time period. If that is something that interests you, take the class!","This class is an amazing way to examine how people perceive each other, in accordance to what they find as \"foreign\". In this course, while we come to see how humans have become more globalized and more politically correct, we are also able to observe how humans have not really evolved far in the way we perceive \"foreign\", in the course's case \"alien\", cultures: through ethnocentric thinking","Be aware that ancient ethnography means that you will be reading a lot of old white dudes postulating about cultures that they have no idea about. Professor Weiss tries to include material from other regions of the world, but there really are very few ethnographic accounts from that time period that are not from the Greeks. So go in understanding that it might get frustrating sometimes to have to read the crap that some of these men write. Take solace in the fact that you get to make fun of them in class.","Professor Weiss is a tad awkward, but she's very sweet, and if you're interested in the Classics even passingly, this should be a fairly interesting class.","While the readings are interesting, the class discussions can be tedious."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"3.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 30H","course_id":"13051","cat_num":"159726","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 30H","course_id":"13051","cat_num":"159726","1s":"3","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
