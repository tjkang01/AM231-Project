It kind of is in the sense that we looked at a lot of Renaissance material.  That's all good but what the course is ACTUALLY about is the translation of architecture through different media. It's totally fascinating."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["rare opportunity to access university collections","Nor is the history of architecture to be exclusively identified with buildings, but also with books, writings and drawings, capable of developing and communicating architectural ideas. If you love books, history and architecture, it is a very appropiate course.","A great small class with Alina as a great professor. It is a one in a million class by being able to go to Houghton and look at amazing books from the 15th and 16th centuries."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"4.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 271p","course_id":"2611","cat_num":"71355","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 271p","course_id":"2611","cat_num":"71355","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 271p","course_id":"2611","cat_num":"71355","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
