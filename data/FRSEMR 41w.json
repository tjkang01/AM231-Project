Caitlin is awesome and discussions are really fun. The \"homework\" is great--we read Jack Kerouac's \"On The Road,\" watch Rebel Without a Cause, and look at vintage ads from the '50s. There's a ton of freedom in what you get to explore and discuss. I highly recommend this class for a fun way to see if you're interested in History and Literature, a cool way to use different kinds of media as sources, and interesting discussions about youth, our generation, and cultural rebellions.","great class","I think this class is only going to get better and better. Really try to do the reading, it makes it more much more enjoyable!","This course is abolutely amazing! After just about every class I rushed back to my dorm to continue the discussion I had in class with my roommate. There is a lot of reading,  but very fun and interesting things. I don't recommend that you take this course with another course that is heavily filled with reading so that you can spend enough time with the material and make the most out of the course. This class also made me like research, something I despised before. This is an amaziamazing course. You'll love it!","You learn things about youth in different times that you can relate to yourself. In a sense, you feel empowered to be young, and it makes you motivated to take advantage of it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"1.33","difficulty":"2.00","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"7","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 41w","course_id":"1861","cat_num":"34207","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 41w","course_id":"1861","cat_num":"34207","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 41w","course_id":"1861","cat_num":"34207","1s":"4","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
