The discussions are not enough to make up for the weaknesses of this course, the biggest one of which is the professor.","Professor Lewalski is very accessible, and an expert in her field.","This is a great way to complete 2 degree requirements, but at times very frustrating.","I would only recommend it to those genuinely enthusiastic about the material. Expect thorough comprehensive introduction to the texts as opposed to close readings of specific moments or narrow focus on particular issues."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This class was extremely interesting-it has made me look at the differences in age (especially regarding gender) in our world today. The reading is fun, and I had not read much 18th-century literature before this class, so this was a great introduction. This was my first English seminar, so I was kind of nervous about the workload, but I found it to be very doable. Professor Gustafson is a great instructor, and she makes our classes interesting and enjoyable. I never felt uneasy or afraid to speak up. She is also great about being accessible outside of class, and truly wants to help you become a better writer and to learn about the subject material.","If you are interested in eighteenth century literature (or childhood and life stages), and woud love a small seminar setting, this is the class for you!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 90ga","course_id":"1497","cat_num":"27098","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 90ga","course_id":"1497","cat_num":"27098","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 90ga","course_id":"1497","cat_num":"27098","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
