It is not necessary, but it would have greatly facilitated my level of comprehension in the course. It is a lot of reading and quite dense."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["While some students dropped out during the first few, theory-driven weeks, persistence into the later case-based weeks really paid off.  Ajantha is one of the better discussion leaders I have come across at Harvard so far.  And while the class takes place in the social anthropology wing of Anthro, a lot of the texts have roots in broader historical, geographical, and design literatures making the class potentially useful for a lot of students.","At least skim Lefebvre before starting the course. Will make the terms of discussion and the underlying logic much clearer.","Thinking about space is an extremely useful approach to anthropological work, the theory might be abstract for the first couple of classes, but very rewarding analytically thereafter."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.75","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.75","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"11","response rate":"72.73","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 2812","course_id":"230","cat_num":"29833","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 2812","course_id":"230","cat_num":"29833","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"6","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 2812","course_id":"230","cat_num":"29833","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
