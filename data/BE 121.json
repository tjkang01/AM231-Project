You will definitely learn a lot of very interesting topics, such as why DNA is a 4-letter system and how to expand the genetic alphabet.","The material covered in this course is really cool and one of the greatest strengths of the course is the lab component, which is optional, but I would definitely recommend doing it. It was a great opportunity to do an independent research project, even though it is a lot of work.","The lab component of the class was very fun and I felt like I learned a lot (it added a lot more work to the class than the lecture component had, however)."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.40","workload":"10.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"BE 121","course_id":"1218","cat_num":"119067","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"BE 121","course_id":"1218","cat_num":"8439","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"BE 121","course_id":"1218","cat_num":"119067","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
