I highly recommend if you are at all interested in non-Western art\/architecture or looking to fulfill the HAA non-Western requirement. Roxburgh is so fun and makes the class very memorable. This class is NOT, however, an undergrad seminar. The course was very much geared to NELC grad students with a couple undergrads thrown in the mix. Not a problem, but it would have been nice to know going in. Don't worry if you can't speak Persian or read Kufic scripts, but be prepared to start out knowing nothing.","If you're interested in this period, in the Timurid dynasty particularly or in Islamic art more broadly, this is a wonderful course that will give you a very rigorous grounding in the material. If you're new to the material, it's likewise a fantastic class, but it's no cakewalk. You must throw yourself into the readings, or you simply will not have a foothold for discussions or for writing and researching your final paper. David Roxburgh is phenomenal lecturer, a brilliant scholar, and absolutely at the top of the field, so there is no one better with whom to take a course on the Timurids. I would not recommend this course to someone hoping to coast through a non-Western art departmental requirement. For someone interested in the methodological challenges of entering a different field, though, I would recommend it very highly. And it seems like a no brainer for someone focused on Islamic art or on medieval Near Eastern cultures. It certainly caused me to reevaluate my assumptions about the discipline of art history and the critical toolbox I apply to my work. And really, what could be better for one's education than that? As an aside, having the excuse to visit David Roxburgh's office hours was one of the best parts of the course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"4.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"8","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 120n","course_id":"2558","cat_num":"9252","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 120n","course_id":"2558","cat_num":"9252","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 120n","course_id":"2558","cat_num":"9252","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
