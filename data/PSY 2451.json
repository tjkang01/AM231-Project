However, it is very much more of a theoretical course where you are asking questions about the structure of racism theories rather than discussing the broader importance or influences of those studies in their context. It's a great course for students who like to think really deeply about psychology theory, though it may be more geared towards a graduate student type of course than an undergraduate so there are those precautions. Otherwise, Jim is incredibly intelligent and pushes you to reap the most from the class!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 2451","course_id":"4328","cat_num":"75368","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 2451","course_id":"4328","cat_num":"75368","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 2451","course_id":"4328","cat_num":"75368","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
