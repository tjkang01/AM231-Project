A lot of fun, learning a lot of cool things, great teaching.","This is primarily a seminar, with 2 - 5 papers read per week. Material is great, with a solid progression. Each class, a student or professor will be teaching new material with a focus on questioning and evaluating the papers. There's a final project, which I thought was asking for a lot of work in both theory and simulation over the course of a few weeks. I found Greg to be a pleasure to work with, and David was fairly accessible, though he can come off as a bit hard to chat with sometimes.","You'll learn a lot of interesting things with a very engaged professor (Parkes). Take it with some of your smart friends to get more out of it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"2.10","difficulty":"2.90","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPSCI 285","course_id":"1280","cat_num":"1060","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPSCI 285","course_id":"1280","cat_num":"1060","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPSCI 285","course_id":"1280","cat_num":"1060","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
