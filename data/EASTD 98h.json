It's a great format and a great way to get a more insightful view of Korean history","Carter Eckert is a fantastic professor and thinker. I am very happy that I got a chance to interact with him closely. I would recommend that anyone even remotely interested in Korean history take this course.","This is a great class!!!! Professor Eckert is wonderful! He really cares about his students and his enthusiasm for Korean history is contagious!","If you have any interested at all in Korea - be from its history, to the situation in North Korea, to the phenomenom of K-pop and the Korean Wave - then you should definitely take this class. Not an East Asian Studies Concentrator? No problem - take it as an elective! (but do make sure you really know a little bit of Korean History and\/or Korean language before jumping into it."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Professor Eckert is an amazing professor who cares very much that his students understand and enjoy the course material. It's not the easiest class in terms of the amount of work per week and the final research paper is a long process, but the more work you put into the course the more rewarding it is."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.25","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EASTD 98h","course_id":"828","cat_num":"29637","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EASTD 98h","course_id":"828","cat_num":"29637","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EASTD 98h","course_id":"828","cat_num":"29637","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
