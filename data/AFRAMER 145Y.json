It would be great if you are anticipating a lot of other things going on in your semester, such as a job hunt or thesis or big performance, and you are interested in the material.","chill class, learn a lot of interesting things and you get to watch luke cage how cool is that","Take this class!","This is one of the few opportunities that you'll have to think about comic books and hiphop culture in an academic setting. You'll emerge thinking more critically about the media you consume on a daily basis.","Definitely take this class. Its one of the classes were you will think a lot about it outside the class. Some of the readings are really awesome. Great speakers come in too.","This class was an absolute gem.  The course material is super interesting and very relevant to in class discussion.  The readings and\/or videos did not take a lot of time and were genuinely enjoyable to read and think about.  Class discussion extended outside of hip-hop culture and comic books and was really used these as a way of talking about the larger issues of race.","Have fun reading all the comics!","Great seminar, very light workload that largely consists of watching shows like Luke cage and reading comics and discussing them.","take this class if you have a a pulse. one of the best classes I have taken and you get to chill at the Hip hop archive too"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"23","response rate":"52.17","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
