But this is a big subject and the course is meant as a survey.","You should take this course if you have a real interest in linguistics; for undergraduates the material may be too specialized to be of general interest to most Classics concentrators.","This course will introduce you to the field of historical linguistics as it relates to Latin. It is not a reading course.","This class is more about phonology and morphology so it can be interesting but don't expect to do a whole lot of readings. You learn about the nitty gritty technicalities of Latin in this course.The inscriptions are interesting.","Take this! You'll have the chance to learn how the Latin language evolved and read awesome inscriptions about bacchanals and sacrifice rituals. Professor Barnes has a superhuman knowledge of linguistics but manages to present it in a manner that is accessible and engaging.","This is a great way to pick up a real credit and get a great introduction to historical linguistics from a very knowledgeable and accessible teacher; and, with the almost negligible workload, it's a great schedule-lightener.","This class is a good way to become familiar with the background of Latin grammar. If you've ever wondered why the first and second conjugations have a different future than the second and third, this and other, similar questions will be answered!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"12","response rate":"58.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LATIN 134","course_id":"5011","cat_num":"1327","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LATIN 134","course_id":"5011","cat_num":"1327","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LATIN 134","course_id":"5011","cat_num":"1327","1s":"2","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
