The teaching staff are really excellent and are very invested in getting to know the students and making the biochemistry of metabolism a really interesting field to learn and understand. Although there were no midterm or final evaluations, I would highly recommend spending a lot of time on the case responses and really engaging with the course material and the really excellent guest lecturers. The student presentation at the end was also a really great chance to hone skills in presenting and also get to hear about a lot of different topics in metabolism from everyone else in the class!","You will learn a lot in a relatively low-stress environment (thanks to no exams.. which was wonderful, I don't know how i would've gotten through this semester if I had to study for this class on top of my other classes). The professors are fun and engaging. It will probably help you with your research or maybe with picking a rotation lab.","Certainly gives an overview of metabolism, both the basics\/fundamentals as well as extending the topic to a graduate level.","If you are looking for a course you can relate to, take BCMP 234.  I learned so much about my body on a macro scale it was a great juxtaposition to the micro world graduate students spend so much time learning about.","This is not a comprehensive or systematic treatment of human metabolism. Think about this course more as a sampler than as an entree or a treatise. The student presentations at the end of the semester touch on a variety of topics and sometimes lack depth, depending on what you are looking for. The course staff seem to subscribe to a single model of learning that may not appear to everyone's taste or learning style\/strategy. Grad students- the class caters more to the needs and preferences of Harvard College pre-meds (juniors and seniors) and may not meet your expectation for a grad-level class.","The clinical correlations are very interesting, but the material is thrown at you quickly.","great review of multiple metabolic pathways in more detail and related to physiology","This course is what you make it. It is kind of basic, but if you dive deeper into the papers, and ask questions accordingly, everyone can get something out of this course.","Be ready, and enjoy the intensive learning process!","I think this is a great class if you are interested in researching metabolic disorders or an undergraduate that wants to go into the medical field. Outside of these areas, the class will likely not be extremely useful to you."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This class is very well organized and interactive, and you learned A LOT in a short period of time","The organizers of the course are great - Dr. Mitchell is phenomenal - and I learned a lot.","I would tell students that this is a must-take course for anyone studying metabolism.

A lot of biological processes (e.g. cell signaling, enzymes) make way more sense after this class, and I'm grateful for how it'll inform my thesis work.","This course is fascinating, and Dr. Michel is a wonderful professor! Starting your oral presentation early is possibly one of the most useful things you can do in this course, and be sure to speak to your TF and Dr. Michel regularly.","This class is just wonderful!","Take this course!","This course is an excellent survey of metabolism and disease.  It is strong on the biology and a brief portion of each segment is spent on the biochemistry.  Great class!","This is a fantastic course. The entirety of the teaching team is highly committed to ensuring high standards of both course material and course organisation, and provide good feedback, especially for the student presentation component of the class. The course material is interesting, spanning a wide range of classical and more recent material in metabolism, from biochemical pathways to cancer cell metabolism to obesity\/microbiome\/energy balance. The clinical aspects of this course are its characteristic and outstanding feature - patient presentation sessions and patient simulation sessions are excellent and add much value, depth and context to the class and course material. You really do get further insights into the physiological and medical contexts of the molecular and cellular components of metabolism. Highly integrative course - as metabolism should be. Highly recommended class if you have any interest in metabolism and the relationship between molecular biology and medicine.","If you are interested in metabolism in health and disease or even just a biochemistry nerd, this class is a must-take.","If you're in the market for a fun course that will give you a brief overview of some interesting topics in human biology, BCMP234 is a great choice. Thomas is a fantastic instructor, all of the guest lecturers are well prepared, and the clinical correlations are extremely informative and enjoyable. Be aware that this course is relatively light, so if you're looking for a rigorous and in-depth metabolism class that will challenge you to be a better researcher, you should look elsewhere. But if you just want a fun class that will get you thinking about some interesting topics, BCMP234 is a great choice."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["If you're interested in metabolism, it will be helpful in terms of getting to know diverse topics of metabolism.

If you can convince yourself to get up for 9am MWF and get to Longwood (for undergrads), it is definitely worth it. I learned so much and had a great time doing it. The lectures were interesting and engaging. There isn't so much work, but the work there is is so well-designed that I feel like it helped me reengage with the material just enough to fully grasp it without being a waste of time.","Review the lecture material frequently.","This class is excellent!

It is very useful for biochemistry and physiology but isn't a very molecular curriculum.","If you're a premed and you've done the Chem 20\/30 route, I would definitely recommend taking this course over Chem 27 to fulfill the biochemistry requirement. It's very well structured, the instructors were generally great, and it's low work load week-to-week.","The class is a great way to integrate knowledge of cellular metabolism to diseases that result from their disorder.","Focus and finish the final presentation early. Choose a fun topic, and try to present it earlier.","A great course that with a fair workload that will offer an excellent overview of metabolic processes.","BCMP 234 is a solid introduction to metabolism, with perspectives ranging from biochemical to molecular to cellular to clinical. The patient interactions are a great opportunity to see real-life applications of the material taught in class. The lectures are generally very solid and do a good job of integrating the material together, as well as providing perspectives on current research in metabolism. The case responses are not time-consuming but very educational in helping solidify material. I took this course as an undergraduate with decent but not outstanding biology background and was fine (though the commute is a bit of a pain).
