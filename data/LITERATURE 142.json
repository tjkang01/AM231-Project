Professor Weir is extremely relatable and flexible but will still guide you through some very difficult theory and its application. The course, however, is what you make out of it, so only expect as much as you're willing to give.","This class is so chill","That it's very heavy on theory that is sometimes difficult to get through, but that you learn a lot and come out of the class with a general knowledge of a lot of film and literary theory.","Some of the theoretical readings are difficult, but they're worth it. Time in class is really useful and the movies are interesting. Also the paper topics are very open which makes them more enjoyable."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"2.60","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LITERATURE 142","course_id":"10683","cat_num":"63943","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LITERATURE 142","course_id":"10683","cat_num":"63943","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LITERATURE 142","course_id":"10683","cat_num":"63943","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
