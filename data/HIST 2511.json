I'm surprised there weren't more historians in the class because I think that while not a methodology class, the course has very much informed how I will go into the archives. The professor was also interested in making connections between the material and each of our disciplinary backgrounds, something that does not always happen.","Historians would benefit from taking this course.","Great selection of readings, provocative and broadly useful for critical thinking about historiography.","There's really no class like this.
