Would highly recommend. Learned a lot and a fun discussion\/lecture combo","This class, especially as taught by Professor Brekus, was one of the highlights of my time at Harvard. It's a great overview of American religious history and focuses on gender, race, class, and sexuality. The format of the class and the readings, field trips, movies, etc. all made this very unlike any other class I've taken. It was also good to practice sharing and giving\/getting feedback on your work with a small group of peers"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"5.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"5","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
