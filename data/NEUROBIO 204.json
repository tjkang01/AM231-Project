The discussions will expand your horizons.","Do yourself and your classmates a favor by reading the paper and writing your summary\/critique ahead of time.  This way, you will have enough time to process what you read and organize your thoughts before the discussion section. You can learn a lot from your classmates during the discussion section, so you should try to be as prepared as possible in order to benefit from your classmates' comments and contribute to their learning with your own comments.

The skill set acquired in this class is far broader and more beneficial than all other graduate level classes."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["great overall introduction to systems neuroscience, with a broad range of topics that are investigated in good detail to understand concepts but not too intense to lose sight of big picture.","A lot of work, especially if you don't have a systems background, but ultimately rewarding if you put in the effort.","This course will blow your mind. But it doesn't matter what I think, you have to take it anyway.","Ask a lot of questions, Participate in discussion... its better that way","The course is good for getting some experience in reading, analyzing, and discussing papers in systems neuroscience. The assignments are helpful, but they get rather tedious since there are 12, which is pretty much once a week.","A well-run course that is worth taking as a neuroscience student, even if you will not go into systems neuroscience.","I'd like to comment on this course as a psychology grad student in an fMRI lab. This course  nicely complements psychology seminars in both content and skill development. In terms of content, the most valuable knowledge I gained from the course is how other measurements of brain function are carried out and analyzed. There is a much larger analysis toolkit used in neurobio that certainly can (and in some cases already does) inform fMRI data analysis. This course is certainly not about memorizing a textbook on neuroscience--rather, the course is really geared developing your skills in understanding and thinking about neurobiology papers. The structured and challenging assignments and in-class 'socratic method' discussion really forced me to do things I would never have otherwise attempted--that is, really try to understand the methods, figures and analyses in systems neuroscience papers; critically assess seemingly excellent papers; and reason about a totally different methodologies for studying the brain than I am accustomed to. Critical assessment skills were particularly emphasized because this was explicitly expected in the assignments (less so the case in the open-ended \"responses papers\" we get in psych seminars). Furthermore, getting feedback on one's critical assessments was really instrumental for developing the confidence that one really *can* understand neuroscience papers and even come up with valid critiques. Ultimately, if the goal is to learn how to read neurobiology papers independently and with a critical eye, this is an excellent course, and worth taking."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["\"It's fun, you'll probably gain useful knowledge, and it's easy to make it work around a rotation.\"","This course is primarily focused on how systems neuroscience relates to visual processing.","Excellent overview of interesting topics in systems neuroscience.

The class can be conceptually challenging, but the amount of actual work required is not too bad.

Even if you have an extensive systems background, you will still learn from this class.","Half of neuroscience is biology of the brain and the other half is trying to understand what that outrageously complex piece of biology is doing.
