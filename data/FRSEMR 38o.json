Strongly recommend if you want to engage with a group of people and with a professor.","This class is an excellent freshman seminar. The pace is great; the materials are interesting. Readings are usually short, and most of the material are movies or documentaries. The topic does not get boring if you stay engaged in the discussion. The only coursework is a group \"provocation,\" an individual presentation, and a group project. These assignments are flexible and allow you to talk about anything you are interested in that is related to the course. This flexibility makes the assignments fairly easy.\n Considering Harvard's lack of Latino studies classes, this seminar is a valuable and rare experience to discuss Latino culture in an academic context. Definitely take advantage of this opportunity.","The seminar is a set of enriching discussions on different aspects of Latino culture in the United States, and I would definitely take it again.","The class was great! We watched a lot of great movies, read interesting articles, and had really productive conversations."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"4.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"11","response rate":"63.64","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 38o","course_id":"12371","cat_num":"81463","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 38o","course_id":"12371","cat_num":"81463","1s":"1","2s":"6","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
