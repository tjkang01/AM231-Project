The 'minor' authors listed, and on whom some writing is required, are not discussed except very briefly in seminars, so it's up to the student to link the conceptual and analytic threads spun through the seminars to these works from the same period but lesser-known authors."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.70","difficulty":"3.30","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 216","course_id":"10773","cat_num":"30579","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 216","course_id":"10773","cat_num":"30579","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 216","course_id":"10773","cat_num":"30579","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
