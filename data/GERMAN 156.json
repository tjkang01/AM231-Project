Great for people interested in Germany and German history, but also good for people interested in philosophy.","You will thank yourself for taking this course - it is part of an important facet of European artistic, intellectual and cultural history, and will make you view the importance and seriousness of cinematic discourse in a whole new way. Not to mention, the professor is an excellent and sophisticated lecturer, and truly an expert in the subject matter (he even partied with some of the actors and has published with some of the directors!).","A great course for film students and students interested in postwar Germany. Combines pivotal literature with a range of films that give a great sense of postwar German cinema, in particular the New German Cinema of the 1970s. Also very accessible for those less familiar with VES courses.","This class is fantastic: a great introduction to film studies through a specific tradition that is explored with the perfect mixture of depth and breadth. Also wonderful for those interested in the German 20th century. Professor Rentschler is a brilliant thinker and a very attentive teacher. Fifty thumbs up!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.83","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.33","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GERMAN 156","course_id":"2108","cat_num":"14735","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GERMAN 156","course_id":"2108","cat_num":"14735","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GERMAN 156","course_id":"2108","cat_num":"14735","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
