It is aimed at people with the mindset and knowledge level of a linguistics concentrator.","The theoretical components\/discussions under the course structure might be slightly more than one usually expects from the course title.","If you want to know more about what linguists discuss, take this class.","You'll learn a lot about current research in experimental\/psycholinguistics.  If you're interested in reading a lot of papers & being exposed to a lot of ideas in contemporary syntax, this is a good class for you!  Don't expect it to be an overview of experimental design, though; it's more a survey of issues in psycholinguistics.  The workload is pretty painless (weekly reading questions, one presentation, one final paper) but don't expect much feedback on how you're doing.  Definitely meet with Greg & Masha to talk about your final paper and your presentation - they're super helpful!  Overall, a good class with a reasonably light workload that I liked but didn't LOVE."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["You will get through a lot of psycholinguistics material, and if you put in the effort to engage with the papers and understand what you're reading, you can get a lot out of it. But if you don't have at least some background in linguistics, you're going to have a hard time.","This class is not overly demanding, allowing students to spend more time on areas in which they are interested, and covers a range of topics, providing a solid foundation for later more in depth research"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LING 130","course_id":"2795","cat_num":"128097","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LING 130","course_id":"2795","cat_num":"76462","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"8","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LING 130","course_id":"2795","cat_num":"128097","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
