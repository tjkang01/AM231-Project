My instructor (Jonas Poulsen) was very encouraging and helpful, which was super useful as my advisor didn't have too much time to help me. I also liked hearing from my peers working on their projects, giving presentations myself, and having deadlines to keep me going on the thesis.","Jonas is the most helpful person on this planet. If you write a thesis, I hope you have him as your preceptor."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Thesis writing is a lot of work and can get frustrating at times. However, it has been one of my most rewarding academic experiences in college. If there is a topic that you are passionate about, I strongly recommend writing a thesis.","Writing a thesis is a daunting task, but it's definitely worth it. I honed my economic research skills considerably and decided based on my experience that I wanted to do more research like this in the future. Start early and ask for lots of help, especially with your econometric strategy. The course staff is great(Jonas was always there to help) and will do their best to assist you."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"12.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"7","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 985SB","course_id":"13798","cat_num":"160782","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 985SB","course_id":"13798","cat_num":"160782","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
