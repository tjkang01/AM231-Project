Janet Lewis is awesome (unfortunately, she taught this in her last year at Harvard).","Incredible course. It's unfortunate that Harvard is losing Dr. Lewis as she is spectacular at running a class-- from guided classroom discussion to a thorough and exciting syllabus to quality assignments, this course receives high marks across the board. One of the best classes I have ever taken at Harvard.","This is an excellent course! I loved the subject material, atmosphere of general discussion, and professor teaching it.","This was one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. It is very sad that Janet is leaving. She is by far the best professor I have had - accessible, brilliant, designed a great course, and gave great feedback. Couldn't have asked for a better class!","This is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. I know that this course has provided me with the knowledge to both continue my studies and perhaps apply for a job related to international relations and interventions. I am so happy I took this class!","There is a ton of reading, and the discussions are challenging.","great class! any interest in developing countries, definitely take this class"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.70","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 94lw","course_id":"2178","cat_num":"35662","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 94lw","course_id":"2178","cat_num":"35662","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"6","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 94lw","course_id":"2178","cat_num":"35662","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
