The course covers many areas of biophysics, some of which are more interesting than others. If one has absolutely no interest in biology or chemistry, I would not suggest this course.","A great overview of biophysical topics, perfect for those who like applications of statistical mechanics.","Do not take any other class during the same term!"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["The course was an excellent and interesting survey of biological physics.  I enjoyed seeing stat mech concepts applied in novel (for me) systems.","Nice introduction to diverse topics; not difficult compared with other physics classes.","Very interesting course!","You'll get a lot of interesting knowledge! Strongly recommend!","This course can be quite useful from a variety of perspectives. For example, I took it as an introduction to physical biology and found it very satisfying and interesting.","This class is particularly useful for graduate students who are enthusiastic about entering biology from a quantitative perspective. It will be particularly useful for people who want to answer theoretical questions in biology","Perhaps a bit too physics-y but a great intro to how statistical physics can be used to address problems in Biology as well as understanding Statistical Mechanics in Biological Systems.","This class is really interesting and changed\/improved how I think of biology. It will give you the foundation to understand a wide range of biophysical problem. Also, Prof. Nelson is a charming, considerate, and engaging lecturer."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.28","workload":"3.17","difficulty":"3.67","recommendation":"4.44","enrollment":"19","response rate":"94.74","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHYSICS 269r","course_id":"4129","cat_num":"6214","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"11","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PHYSICS 269r","course_id":"4129","cat_num":"6214","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"9","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHYSICS 269r","course_id":"4129","cat_num":"6214","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"11","4s":"5","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
