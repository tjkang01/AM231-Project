Very useful for learning more about research design, and great for being exposed to a range of perspectives on IR which are certainly not present in the IR field seminar.","Despite my earlier criticisms, this is an excellent course that is ably taught."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Great class, take it!","Really be prepared to develop your \"worldview\" in class. Don't just read the reading and know the author's argument. Don't just understand the weaknesses of the author's argument. Think of how YOU feel about the author's argument. Is the evidence presented enough to convince YOU? What kind of work, what methodology, is the type that you believe determines how systems work, how nations interact? This is what I learned in this class.
