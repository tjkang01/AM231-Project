Ewa is amazing! If you are interested on the Enlightenment, this course is a must-take. If not, you will learn a great deal of things that could relate to multiple fields and you will acquire great historical skills. So don't hesitate!","This professor inspires loyalty and enthusiasm in her students. I think this is because of the respect she shows everyone. She gives ample credit and praise, and is very fair. The material is indeed challenging, but if you make mistakes she'll guide you with measured, careful comments. It doesn't matter whether you are new to the material or not."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"11.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"11","response rate":"81.82","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
