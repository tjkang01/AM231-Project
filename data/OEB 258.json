Be aware, though, to not take other courses at the same time and to dedicate most of your time to this one course.\"","Interesting discussions about an interesting topic with one of the foremost experts on the topic, however it may not be broadly applicable to those not 100% interested in that topic","OEB has so few graduate offerings, so I'd recommend the course on that alone. That said, this is the most fun I've had taking a course in years.
