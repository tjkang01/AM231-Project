Kim's style of teaching and her lecture series were one of the best.  I would highly recommend this course to any students who have a desire to learn something about Korea and its history and culture.","This class really helps you to learn in an interactive way through the near-weekly guest lectures and performances. The guest lecturers who come are distinguished scholars in specific fields in late Choson Korea, and they are often the authors of our readings-- an opportunity that is amazing and unmatched.","This is an excellent survey course for Korean Choson history.  It is an excellent class for those who would like to gain a deeper understanding of late pre-modern Korean history.  I would highly recommend it."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Go for it! If a class like this is offered again, I would highly recommend it. Being only two-hours a week and having a small course enrollment, this course did not ask too much out of me and also allowed me to get to know my classmates and Professor better than some of the larger lecture classes that I am in. Plus such an environment also allowed me to learn the course material better and pushed me to always do my best. If possible, I honestly believe that every Harvard student should take a course like this one at least once during their time here, regardless of the school or level that they are at.","Great seminar! Don't miss it!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.75","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"KORHIST 118","course_id":"890","cat_num":"3231","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"KORHIST 118","course_id":"890","cat_num":"3231","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"KORHIST 118","course_id":"890","cat_num":"3231","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
