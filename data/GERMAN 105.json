Regardless of what else you have going on for other courses, you will be expected to show up at every rehearsal, and they all last for hours because they are so disorganized and the professor pauses at the end of every line to give feedback.","This was a fun class and allowed me to learn something about a topic I knew nothing about!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.00","workload":"3.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"2.70","enrollment":"4","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
