It was my first exposure to historiography, and covered family history, which I found really interesting even though I'm more of an economic historian. Three hours literally flew by, we all had so much to say, all of these nuances and big ideas to hammer out. It was lots and lots of fun in class! It was a lot of reading, and you really want to pay attention to it so you're completely prepared for the three hours. The essays take a lot of time, too, even though they are all short, because you have to be so precise about what you're arguing when it's that short. So difficult class, but it was super-interesting, and I enjoyed it a lot.","Be ready to work hard but get a lot out of the course.","History 97 can at times feel like bootcamp or more accurately Expos 4.0 with more papers and closer deadlines. It will improve your ability to write papers but can at times be a lot to handle and feel tedious. Nevertheless, Elizabeth and Professor Kamensky are excellent. However, the History Tutorial still needs to be restructured.","This was an amazing course, and definitely my favorite at Harvard so far. The teaching staff are awesome, and very approachable and welcoming. It is a great introduction to the History concentration and writing History papers. It made me fall in love with the History concentration by far! Definitely heard the best things about this History 97 compared to the other ones"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"10.90","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 97J","course_id":"13534","cat_num":"160421","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 97J","course_id":"13534","cat_num":"160421","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
