The films are interesting, as are the readings. If you have any interest in this subject, I would highly recommend the class.","This is a fantastic course that not only teaches you how to analyze Chinese film, make Chinese film, but also have an enhanced appreciation for the auteur. Course is very manageable provided you have solid time management skills, and Prof. Li is an expert who imparts her knowledge with great tact. This course has a unique focus that is often glossed over in other courses, be they film or history, and this class masterfully blends both while also teaching you skills in a brilliant way. If you have a passing interest in film, or East Asian film, you owe it to yourself to check this course out.","You get to work on a lot of creative assignments (if you want) and they're fun! If you don't want to do those, the written assignments available are not too intense.","Class was really fun, and the final project, while time consuming, was a great experience. I would definitely work in a group earlier on if I took the class again,. The films are interesting, and although some of them I didn't love, we only spent a week on each."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"1.50","difficulty":"2.20","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"13","response rate":"61.54","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EAFM 150","course_id":"10700","cat_num":"14983","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EAFM 150","course_id":"10700","cat_num":"14983","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EAFM 150","course_id":"10700","cat_num":"14983","1s":"4","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
