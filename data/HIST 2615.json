I think this has to do with the extremely diffuse responsibility that results from having three professors and a TF: if taught by one professor, I think it has the potential to be fantastic.","I don't think this class will be offered again, since the class we're designing will be taught, but I would absolutely recommend GEN ED curriculum design classes and classes taught by the three professors.","This class needs better organization and clarity.","This class is a great chance to discuss the challenges that expect you when you start teaching \/ the challenges you encounered in your teaching so far. I would especially recommend this class to people who are in their first year of teaching or about to start teaching.","Be prepared to spend at least five hours on this course per week. If you are not interested in getting some pedagogical perspectives, then this course might not be useful for you."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"6.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.60","enrollment":"14","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
