At some point it seemed like we stopped making progress on our projects, but that might have changed if I had more time to devote to it. Make sure you choose something you are really interested in and have fun with it!","Though it's not exactly stated in the course description, the entire class is designed for you to learn how to conceptualize a theater performance (basically from scratch) and to make sure it's thematically sound and has a strong premise. The multimedia aspect comes from discussions of the techniques involved and how to incorporate them into your concept. The class, for me, felt like it hit a lull midway through during the semester and I did feel some kind of disconnect between the assignments and the final goal of the project. That said, Professor Romanska is incredible - she cares so much for the students and is always willing to meet and talk about your project. Ultimately, I do feel like I gained what I should from the class, though I think the class could still use some polish (which makes sense as it's the first time it's been taught)."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"TDM 169DA","course_id":"13036","cat_num":"160650","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"TDM 169DA","course_id":"13036","cat_num":"160650","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
