Seminars every 3 lectures, and lab every 3 lectures. Both of these end up becoming 10 minute presentations based on the reading\/film material, to the rest of the class, in Italian.","This course is amazing- unfortunately the professor is only visiting, but it really was wonderful. You get to practice your Italian which learning a lot and analyzing many texts. Most classes are spent presenting your own summaries and ideas, which is great fun!","This course was great in that it was trans-temporal, and did not just focus on one aspect of Rome. However, it wasn't a traditional history course, but more so a literature\/film\/theory course in which you deconstruct the city from a number of major themes that have persisted throughout its history. It is an awesome introduction to modern Italy, especially with Prof. Pedriali as the guiding hand, as she is an expert in the area and will make connections you wouldn't have thought of otherwise. With that being said, she allowed us to make our connections, as we presented biweekly on secondary\/primary texts\/movies, letting us to create our own ideas of the city and the nation. Really great class!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"6.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ITAL 132","course_id":"12815","cat_num":"14159","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ITAL 132","course_id":"12815","cat_num":"14159","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
