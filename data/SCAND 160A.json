My issue is more with how the course worked in the sense that we never really had time to learn the grammatical forms. Instead we just kept doing translations, which might work for some, but I kind of got out without really knowing much Old Norse, which is pretty unfortunate.","Pin down exactly what you should be doing outside of class. I didn't, and I was a bit confused about whether I was doing enough.","This is a really fun class if you're interested in Vikings and Old Norse literature. You get to start translating passages right away. Throughout the semester, there isn't a lot of emphasis in memorizing tables and vocab, but don't fall behind because you'll need to know it for the final (which is worth almost all of your grade). Overall, an enjoyable class.","Talos inn m\u00c3\u00a1ttigi! Talos inn \u00c3\u00babilandi!
