The professors are inspiring and it is quite a wonderful experience to hear them share their stories of the past, memories, and experiences in the field. Great for anyone interested in where medical anthropology comes from and where it is headed. The Goods are really special to work with!","The course is disorganized and the course overall suffered from lack of structure.","Students who take this course should definitely feel comfortable with medical anthropology terms.","It's a good opportunity to understand the field of medical anthropology.","Future students will only get something out of this course if they work hard.","For an undergraduate, this is a great way to be introduced to graduate-level discussions and material with the close attention of professors."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.23","workload":"2.38","difficulty":"3.31","recommendation":"3.69","enrollment":"14","response rate":"92.86","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 2795","course_id":"228","cat_num":"55818","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"6","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 2795","course_id":"228","cat_num":"55818","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"9","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 2795","course_id":"228","cat_num":"55818","1s":"1","2s":"7","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
