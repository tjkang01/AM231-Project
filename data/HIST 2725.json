History\/Anthropology is a tough class, in what it demands of you and in how it disrupts one's settled ways of thinking. This is a good thing.","If you want a broad overview of the history of certain theoretical themes in history and anthropology, then the course is great. Discussion is challenging but enlightening, and Vince and Ajantha cultivate a friendly atmosphere. The course brings together students from all across the university with very different interests but a common passion for critical thinking (not even theory necessarily). Even if you have not done much coursework in the history and anthropology department, you can thrive in the course and gain a lot from the course since it makes you think differently about your research.","Great course for anyone interested in doing interdisciplinary work in either field.","For history students: This class was a good way to read and grapple with theoretical issues that don't come up as frequently in other courses. If you don't naturally want to read theory, this class is a good way to make sure you get enough of it to understand what other people who do read theory are talking about."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["As a historian, I would definitely recommend this course. It's very carefully put together, and each week encouraged me to rethink some of the fundamental methods and concepts of my own work - the best course I've taken at grad school.","Be creative."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"7.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"8","response rate":"62.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 2725","course_id":"11457","cat_num":"26038","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 2725","course_id":"11457","cat_num":"26038","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 2725","course_id":"11457","cat_num":"26038","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
