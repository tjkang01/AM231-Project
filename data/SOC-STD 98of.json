Though if you already took Anya'a tutorial on inequality, the readings might feel repetitive.","Professor McClendon makes it awesome\/stress-free. You learn a lot about both the material and writing\/research. Great for thesis preparation on any type of inequality.","This class is hands down one of the most enjoyable and particularly formative classes that I have taken here at Harvard these last three years. Professor McClendon is phenomenal, and the material is beyond interesting through many different perspectives.","Amazing Social Studies tutorial - the readings are all really fascinating as is the course structure generally. Professor McClendon is really great at weaving all of the readings into the discussion in a way that doesn't feel forced at all. She's also really supportive and helpful with final projects, and is open to various ideas\/methods. Overall, a phenomenal experience!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"2.10","difficulty":"2.90","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"10","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOC-STD 98of","course_id":"11156","cat_num":"42851","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOC-STD 98of","course_id":"11156","cat_num":"42851","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOC-STD 98of","course_id":"11156","cat_num":"42851","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
