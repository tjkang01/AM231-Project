Definitely for those who have a strong interest in the subject material, however.","This class is essential for students who would like to carry out their own folk art studies, but would be a valuable and engaging course for any student.  It provides a deeper understanding of the concept of \"folk\" and the ways it has been used historically."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This is a fun class with a great professor and room to follow your interests. Just be aware that it's more about the concept of folk art than folk art itself.","A really great class and not just because Felicity Lufkin makes the topics approachable and interesting. The straight discussion format worked really well and made for a great class dynamic helping me understand and appreciate the topics more than I thought I would or could."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FOLKMYTH 170","course_id":"1761","cat_num":"1278","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FOLKMYTH 170","course_id":"1761","cat_num":"1278","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FOLKMYTH 170","course_id":"1761","cat_num":"1278","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
