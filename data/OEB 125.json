Otherwise, you may feel bogged down with too much information, too many examples, too many equations, and not enough interest.","You will learn something about evolution, but the only real reason to take this class is if you are planning on using evolution related computer programs.","It is a thorough introduction to the methodologies and issues involved in molecular evolution.  The computer lab, in particular, is a good way to learn how to do molecular phylogenetic analysis.  The lectures are interesting but often disorganized and hard to follow.  I had to do a lot of work on my own to synthesize the ideas and figure out the big picture.","It's an incredibly informative, interesting course taught by exceedingly enthusiastic people.","It is taught very well and the instructors are very enthusiastic about the topic.  Professor Edwards does a good job of creating enthusiasm for the course.","Its a very useful and informative class, though I would only recommend it to those with a strong interest in the subject matter.","This is a great class for students interested in population biology and population genetics. I recommend taking this class before taking Wakeley's population genetics."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This course provides a decent introduction to the use of molecules in ecology and evolution.  But it is intensive and takes a good deal of tie to fully understand some abstract concepts."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.67","workload":"2.33","difficulty":"3.33","recommendation":"3.67","enrollment":"5","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"OEB 125","course_id":"3950","cat_num":"2691","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"OEB 125","course_id":"3950","cat_num":"2691","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"OEB 125","course_id":"3950","cat_num":"2691","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
