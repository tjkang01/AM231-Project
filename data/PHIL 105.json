The readings seemed distant at times from what was discussed in lecture. Make no mistake, the Stoic readings are interesting and a definite must-read, but I was disappointed by how little we could talk about the works specifically because Doyle would often talk about secondary literature or comparisons to historical context to a point that it could feel lost. \r\n\r\nIf you have taken Ancient Philosophy, definitely take this course. Otherwise, just know 2-hours in a room on tangential material can be rough."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.20","workload":"4.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.10","enrollment":"9","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHIL 105","course_id":"13333","cat_num":"159685","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHIL 105","course_id":"13333","cat_num":"159685","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
