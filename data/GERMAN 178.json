Classes were consistently stimulating, and Ian does an amazing job interspersing class discussions with film excerpts, passages from primary and secondary texts, and close readings. The syllabus is also extremely well constructed; there is sense of continuity and progression as the course unfolds. I would highly recommend this class.","A unique course in terms of content that bridges literature and film and focuses on a subject not necessarily covered over the course of traditional academic tracks","You will come out of this class a more educated person. The workload is reasonable while also allowing you to delve into some pretty complex ideas. If you appreciate film or want to learn to appreciate it more this class is also great.","The class was an excellent expose of the dystopian, explored mostly through film, with a few critical texts to supplement the exploration of the dystopian in the cinematic history of Germany and Hollywood.","Ian was an amazing teacher and I encourage you to take his class. This class initially made me the most nervous as I am not familiar with German Dystopia, but it quickly became my favorite class; the material was interesting and provoked thoughtful conversations, assignments were graded quickly and with useful feedback, and Ian is an overall joy to be around and learn from.","This class is really great.  It takes a scholarly, analytical approach to a genre (though after taking the course you might debate whether the dystopian qualifies as a genre or not) that is often seen as popular, content-less, or not worthy of serious examination--and soundly disproves those misconceptions."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"2.10","difficulty":"2.90","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"9","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GERMAN 178","course_id":"10863","cat_num":"25305","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GERMAN 178","course_id":"10863","cat_num":"25305","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"8","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GERMAN 178","course_id":"10863","cat_num":"25305","1s":"0","2s":"8","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
