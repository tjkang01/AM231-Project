I was very interested in the topic, so I enjoyed this class. Others who may be less interested in analyzing the legality of surveillance may not find this course the best fit.","lots of reading to do.","Expos sucks, but as far as expos classes go, this one is pretty good. Interesting topic, although professor Sinnott is just okay. Overall, not that much work compared to other expos classes so I'd recommend it. Just wouldn't tell people to expect it to be your favorite class.","The class was great. It was Expos but with a nice twist. We read Supreme Court opinions, government reports on surveillance, and different evaluations about the modern state of surveillance. The time in class is also a great place to discuss the different opinions that can surge from the readings.","Take this class if you are interested in modern surveillance laws.","The workload is a perfect balance - challenging but not heavy at all\/very manageable. The subject is fascinating - the intersection between collection of metadata and the protection of people's privacy rights. I love how we cover both the technical aspects of the NSA's program but also the philosophical groundings of privacy in general.","If you're interested in the privacy debate and the controversy surrounding the NSA surveillance programs, then this is the course for you. If not, then you'll probably be bored with this course.","Interesting and useful subject material - a great way to do expos while actually learning something else important"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"4.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"14","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.282","course_id":"12749","cat_num":"43262","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.282","course_id":"12749","cat_num":"43262","1s":"0","2s":"11","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
