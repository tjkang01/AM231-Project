A class of about seven people discussing weekly the questions that arose with the weekly readings, led by Professor Usher and guided by our own curiosity. Being able to take this course with Professor Usher (who is so passionate about what he does that he flew weekly to Boston just for this!) was a gift and I feel extremely lucky to have been able to enjoy every single moment of it. I definitely recommend to anyone who thinks they might find this topic interesting and\/or want to practise their French.","It is certainly a challenging course, but a very valuable one.  The readings can be hard to penetrate at times.  However, the class is also hugely inspiring.  Phillip, with his passion, perceptiveness, and thoughtful nature, lent a wonderful atmosphere to the discussions.  The course offers unparalleled opportunity to explore the wealth of Harvard's collection of Renaissance books.  For me, this course reaffirmed the relevance of the humanities, as we pondered the implications of the concept of gigantism and of divinity in the present day."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"4.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRENCH 140","course_id":"13021","cat_num":"160567","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRENCH 140","course_id":"13021","cat_num":"160567","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
