He gave good feedback on the papers as well.  I also enjoyed looking at one author in depth and understanding his writing as opposed to a class with a topic basis and several different authors.  It was a different approach that I felt worked well.","Great if you're interested in Kipling","This class is fantastic. The workload is moderate (the books are all fun to read), discussion is interesting, and Professor Kaiser is a wonderful teacher.","Not a lot of work, but the writing is pretty boring.","If you've never read much Kipling, this is the class for you. Completely changed my opinion of him, and for the better. Great course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"1.75","difficulty":"2.38","recommendation":"3.88","enrollment":"9","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 90k","course_id":"1503","cat_num":"71872","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 90k","course_id":"1503","cat_num":"71872","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 90k","course_id":"1503","cat_num":"71872","1s":"3","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
