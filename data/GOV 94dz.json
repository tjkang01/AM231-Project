If gov 20 or gov 97 topics interested you, take this course!  Professor Ziblatt is also the man and a great professor to get to know through this tutorial!","The discussion component is mediocre, not terrible but not awesome.  Good readings. Feedback took a while, but was good.","Prof Ziblatt is great!","Interesting class about democracy with fantastic material. Professor Ziblatt really tries to be available and provide as much help as he can with the final paper or with understanding the readings.","This was a solid course. The truth is it was kind of repetitive for someone who has taken Gov 20 and is well versed in comparative politics. Nevertheless, it had some solid readings. Plus, Professor Ziblatt is really kind and engaging. He's always willing to speak in depth outside of class, so it was great to take advantage of access to him.","Gov 94dz: Take this class if you have interest in the subject matter.  Do not worry if you do not have previous Gov experience.  Ziblatt is a very good teacher and is very sympathetic."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"2.60","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"13","response rate":"69.23","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 94dz","course_id":"10871","cat_num":"48953","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 94dz","course_id":"10871","cat_num":"48953","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"5","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 94dz","course_id":"10871","cat_num":"48953","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
