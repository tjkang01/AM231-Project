For those who want to do radio astronomy, rather than those who want to learn about radio sources.","With enough effort can learn quite a bit.","Jim has a wonderful didactic style.

While I certainly learned a lot, I don't feel that I have a cohesive picture of radio astronomy at all. I struggled through the problem sets and had to ask for help a lot. The topics we covered seemed very disjoint, and I would find it difficult to apply any of them in a practical way. The lab assignments were very difficult but, at the very least, illustrated the concepts from class in a hands-on way that made them easier to understand.","I thought it was going to be more about the science of radio astronomy when the majority of the class was about the antenna systems.","I would emphasize that the course focuses on the technical aspects of radio astronomy, and is as such a particularly useful course for those seeking to become radio astronomers or utilize radio data."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.00","workload":"13.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ASTRON 218","course_id":"280","cat_num":"112022","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ASTRON 218","course_id":"280","cat_num":"2883","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ASTRON 218","course_id":"280","cat_num":"112022","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
