Analytical tools taught in this course can be used for research in any scientific field.","This was a very time involved course. The problem sets were difficult and some of the problems didn't work out.","This is a course you should definitely take if it is offered. It is highly instructive and you will find the material extremely useful to you research no matter what you do. From purely experimental work to purely computational and theoretical this course will make you master tools and skill that are relevant to all fields and extremely useful for a broad class of problems. The homeworks are fairly time consuming and require a good background in numerical methods (preferably good Matlab Skills) Linear Algebra and Computational Linear Algebra. \r\n\r\nIf this course is offered, don't think it twice. Take it!","only take it if it is NOT taught as 3hrs once\/week. but the material is very very useful and the instructor is kind\/cares about his students.","This was a very interesting class taught in a very engaging way, and with an excellent line-up of guest lecturers! The only thing I disliked about the class was the fact that the problem sets often contained many typos and unclear questions. Hopefully this will be improved in future iterations of the course.","Inverse problems are a broad topic, and this course is correspondingly broad. Maha is an inspiring lecturer in the first half of the semester, and the guest lecture series in the second half of the semester highlighted a huge diversity of fields in which inverse problems are used. Assignments included 3 long problem sets involving mostly linear algebra and Matlab, and an open-ended final project of one's own choosing. In some sense, this is a great survey course in applied mathematics.","You'll learn a lot about inverse problems and how to solve them. Getting decent looking results for the homework problems is very rewarding."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"8.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"23","response rate":"60.87","QCourseOverall":{"number":"APMTH 216","course_id":"13466","cat_num":"135919","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"4","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"APMTH 216","course_id":"13466","cat_num":"135919","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
