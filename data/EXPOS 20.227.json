Take it seriously!","as far as expos goes, pursuing happiness seems like a solid choice. it wasn't that difficult for me, and the subject is fairly interesting. the preceptor isn't incredibly engaging or knowledgable, but he's knowledgable and friendly","Help Karas out and contribute to the conversation, it makes class so much better.","It's a great class where you learn a lot of applicable and interesting knowledge","Its as good of an expos topic as you can find. As far as expos goes, this is great.","This is a great class that takes a far more in-depth look at happiness and efforts to make the most of it globally. It has a really nice and smart preceptor. Students will find it a fascinating and greatly rewarding experience, all the while filling the Expos requirement, if interested - as I believe most people should and would be - in looking at happiness through the lens of Bentham and Mill's philosophical texts on utilitarianism, measuring and analyzing happiness across countries with the Easterlin paradox and \"the hedonic treadmill\" theory of happiness economics, and the history of American positivity literature and how it translates into today's booming field of \"positive psychology\" and the financial crisis. In our year, we wrote our first paper as an argumentative close analysis of Mill's Utilitarianism, our second on the economics of how individual happiness is different from group happiness, and our third as a final research paper looking at psychology and arguing about how a factor of our choice affects happiness.","The subject is interesting, the teacher is very nice, but the actual class section was not as stimulating as I had hoped. I think my writing definitely improved but I felt I had to go to the writing center to really figure out what the teacher wanted."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.73","workload":"1.91","difficulty":"3.09","recommendation":"4.18","enrollment":"15","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.227","course_id":"10615","cat_num":"49721","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 20.227","course_id":"10615","cat_num":"49721","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"8","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.227","course_id":"10615","cat_num":"49721","1s":"3","2s":"6","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
