I would recommend this course to students experimenting w\/ research methods and theory, and open to the possibility of working across multiple disciplines and fields.","Zeghal is amazing--she cuts through the noise to get at what is useful about various kinds of research concerning Islam and politics from anthropological, historical, quantitative, and other methodologies.","This is a fantastic course for developing your ability to prepare a research topic and question, think through methodology and explore sources to answer a question you pose yourself. It also exposes you to a great variety of literature in theory of government, then islam and government, and a variety of ways this topic has been studies (statistically, ethnographically, multi-level analysis, etc.)","I would tell them that this course carries a heavy work load, but that Professor Zeghal is brilliant, and very open to sharing her ideas and feedback with her students."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"8","response rate":"62.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 1080","course_id":"13005","cat_num":"156079","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 1080","course_id":"13005","cat_num":"156079","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
