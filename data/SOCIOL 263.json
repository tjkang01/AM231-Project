'13":{"comments":["Excellent course! Listening to Orlando weave together insights from cognitive psych to institutional economics, with social theory and his own political experiences...well, it was a rare, precious experience each week.","Make an effort to do all of the reading and come prepared with questions for class. It is discussion heavy and the more work you put in before class, the better the discussion.","Great opportunity to discuss topical and controversial issues in an open environment.  Very good opportunity to explore the fundamental issues that continue to influence today's policy dilemmas."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This course is a truly interdisciplinary course which takes material from both the social and other sciences and tries to create synthesis.","This has been one of my favorite courses at Harvard. Prof. Patterson is amazing and knowledgeable about the subject matter. He is willing and readily accessible to discuss the course material. A must take.","Orlando is a scholar from another era - witnessing his engagement with the debates of historical sociology is something to behold, and he is also very generous with his time."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["The course is fascinating!
