He's a teddy bear of a professor (my favorite at Harvard), very approachable, and he always manages to make students feel comfortable.","Subject material is essential for scientific research. Excellent way to learn about microscopy and imaging.","This class taught the fundamentals of microscopy at a very basic level and provided simple explanations of more advanced techniques, but I wish there was more focus on how the techniques could be used for various applications.","It's a difficult class. You need to learn a lot of concepts on your own if you are not up to speed with lectures.","Cool course, great professor, and well-run.","it's a laid back class, but you still need to keep up with it on a regular basis","I would tell people to enjoy this class as fully as possible.  It doesn't require much from the student, and the teaching staff recognizes that.  Instead, it encourages exploration and fosters an appreciation for the subject that might not be possible in a class with too much reading.","It is fun, interesting and extremely helpful for anyone interested in pursuing research that involves the use of imaging.","Really cool class with interesting material and awesome projects.  One of the best I've taken at Harvard, especially in terms of teaching, material, assignments, and relevance."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.52","workload":"1.38","difficulty":"2.43","recommendation":"4.71","enrollment":"27","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MCB 173","course_id":"3558","cat_num":"3836","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"8","5s":"12"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MCB 173","course_id":"3558","cat_num":"3836","1s":"3","2s":"8","3s":"8","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MCB 173","course_id":"3558","cat_num":"3836","1s":"13","2s":"8","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
