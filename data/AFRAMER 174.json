Great interdisciplinary class.","Free form and pleasantly random."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Very interesting, very personalized, fairly disorganized.","This excellent for some students, discombobulating for others.","it is a nice, calm way to do a tutorial.  thats for sure.  Don't expect to be babied, you definitely make the class what you will, but you won't fail if you just cruise.  Win-win to me.","Blier is fantastic - very easy going and very open to creative ideas. The course itself is wonderful. You pick a city to study all term, write blog posts every week about a different aspect, and then write a final paper at the end. Great class.","There are a lot of really cool things about this class. You learn to rectify maps and overlay them onto satellite imagery, which is awesome. You learn a lot of history and sociological concepts relevant to urbanism in Africa, which is sometimes dry but usually really interesting. You also get really in-depth knowledge of the city you choose to study, which for me, at least, was challenging but worth every bit of effort I put into it. Highly recommended."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["Great class! Very individualized and engaging :)","It's helpful if you just want to know about basic information of African cities","This is a great way for students with little knowledge about African cities to begin learning about a city in depth."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"6.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"9","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AFRAMER 174","course_id":"67","cat_num":"118130","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AFRAMER 174","course_id":"67","cat_num":"6977","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AFRAMER 174","course_id":"67","cat_num":"118130","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
