The structure of the course--two books and a paper per week--lends itself to integrated historiographical learning as well as communal learning about a given period. Students are taught to teach each other, and gain an incredible wealth of knowledge of the field.","It is a great course to get a grip on the historiography of pre-twentieth-century African American history. It will help you understand the important themes of the field, and how historians have treated them. And it will let you read the \"classics\" of the field -- a great way to prepare for field exams, if you plan to take one in African American history.","Since we cover so much material, it is a great preparation for fields.  Although Prof. Higginbotham is an expert in the field, she is very respectful of students and nurtures their acquisition of knowledge."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["Professor Higginbotham is extremely knowledgeable, and you will come away from this course with an excellent understanding of the major topics and historiographical debates in African-American history.  You'll read the newest literature on these topics alongside classics from throughout the 20th century.  And Professor Higginbotham is interested in and supportive of her students' interests and projects, which shows in her feedback on the papers you'll write for this course."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Lots of reading, class can be stressful when having to present individual texts","Get ready to read two books per week."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"8.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AFRAMER 218","course_id":"84","cat_num":"9951","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AFRAMER 218","course_id":"84","cat_num":"9951","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AFRAMER 218","course_id":"84","cat_num":"9951","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
