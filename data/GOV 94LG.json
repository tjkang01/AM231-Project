Although put a lot of time into the final project!!","The professor is absolutely amazing. She manages to keep the classroom environment very chill, but still very intellectually stimulating. I would recommend it if you have any interest in political theory or law. I say political theory because even though that is not the main point of the course at all, it inevitably comes up and contributes to the discussion in interesting ways. If you are interested in law, this is absolutely for you! You get to dissect legal reasoning very closely.","Great class!  Very theory based, but if you're into that, it's very worthwhile.  Discussions were very interesting and everyone learned from each other (in addition to from professor Rosenblum, of course).","This was my favorite class at Harvard. Professor Rosenblum is incredibly nice and she always facilitates engaging conversations. I wish I had taking other courses with her.","Even if you are not interested in going to law school, you should still take this course. Its incredible and one of my favorite classes at Harvard.","There is minimal written work but you still learn a great deal through interacting with your classmates, which is the best form of learning in my opinion."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"14","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 94LG","course_id":"10880","cat_num":"109736","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 94lg","course_id":"10880","cat_num":"62463","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 94LG","course_id":"10880","cat_num":"109736","1s":"1","2s":"9","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
