He is very patient, and makes sure that you truly understand even the most difficult parts of the text.","The current instructor of the course - Prof. Granara - does not structure the course in a way that the student grows in historically knowledge or linguistic knowledge of Arabic historical sources. The depth and breadth of the course was limited, unstructured, and most definitively repetitive. Yet, if you want an 'easy' course - which I pray no one who has come to Harvard to do a grad degree does - then Prof. Granara's method will best suit you."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"12","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ARABIC 243ar","course_id":"11048","cat_num":"41216","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"5","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ARABIC 243ar","course_id":"11048","cat_num":"41216","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"8","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ARABIC 243ar","course_id":"11048","cat_num":"41216","1s":"1","2s":"8","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
