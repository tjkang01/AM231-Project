The two novels, Petronius' Satyricon and Apuleius' Golden Ass\/Metamorphoses are very entertaining. You will learn not only about the clever style of these two authors, but also about the Roman novel and literature as a whole, Roman society, and ancient religion. Be prepared for the level and amount of reading. Both authors write at a fairly advanced level, and Apuleius is especially challenging. Expect to be reading 100-200 lines per class. You're Latin will greatly improve and the small class setting provides some very interesting discussion!","This is an excellent opportunity to practice your reading skills at a manageable but moving pace. Come to each class having done the reading, as it will be obvious if you haven't and missing several readings will catch up on you.","Do the translations and readings! They're hard at first, but the work is very rewarding.","Fantastic","This class was a wonderful and very engaging course. The balance between translation and conversation was perfect and greatly enriched my appreciation for the ancient novel. The Latin text was always entertaining, class discussions were always well-facilitated and engaging, and in-class translations were most helpful.","Take this class!  The Satyrica and Metamorphoses are hysterical and fascinating works."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"8.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LATIN 121","course_id":"12686","cat_num":"99229","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"LATIN 121","course_id":"12686","cat_num":"99229","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
