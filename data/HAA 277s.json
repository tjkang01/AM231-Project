Carrie Lambert-Beatty's teaching method is inclusive, participatory, democratic -- these structuring principles echo and feed off of the theories that weave their way through the course. Overall, \"Circa 1970\" was a strong conjugation of theoretical reflection and art historical case studies. It was a provocative rethinking of the art history of the period. One had the sense, from week to week, that something unusual was happening in the room. It was in many ways an exemplary research seminar: an adventurous revision of a period, set of theoretical arguments, body of work, etc., and a trip that everyone felt was being taking together, as a group. One had the feeling that new ground was being broken at each session, and that everyone was an active participant in the discovery."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["A fascinating survey of issues relating to the politicization of avant-garde art around 1970. The readings were excellently selected, offering a wide array of methodological and theoretical approaches to the material. Carrie clearly has a lot going on outside of class, but made many sincere efforts to be available nonetheless.","This is an essential seminar for anyone interested in the relation between art, media and politics. Professor Lambert-Beatty is a generous and dedicated teacher, and it is a pleasure to both engage in discussion and write final papers under her helpful guidance."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.71","workload":"2.57","difficulty":"3.57","recommendation":"3.86","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 277s","course_id":"2623","cat_num":"2286","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 277s","course_id":"2623","cat_num":"2286","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 277s","course_id":"2623","cat_num":"2286","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
