I really liked the guest speakers Dr. Rubin lined up, and I felt that he had chosen professors from a variety of areas that were specifically interested in teaching undergraduates (for the most part). I appreciated having the opportunity to meet a lot of the professors and taking the class alongside graduate students - it made the discussion reach a much higher level than in any of my science classes thus far, something I really benefitted from. \r\n\r\nTake this class!","This class is nice because you will get to meet the many amazing scientists from around Harvard and you'll know what they are going to publish in Nature after 2 weeks!","super easy- just start the final paper early"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"1.30","difficulty":"2.40","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SCRB 200","course_id":"4896","cat_num":"88356","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SCRB 200","course_id":"4896","cat_num":"88356","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SCRB 200","course_id":"4896","cat_num":"88356","1s":"5","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
