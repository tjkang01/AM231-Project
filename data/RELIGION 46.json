It's hard not to enjoy a course when a professor is obviously concerned with the academic well-being of her students. Professor Nasrallah is one of the most invested and genuine instructors that I have had the privilege to learn under. Everyone's thoughts are valued in this course. Oh, and the Apostle Paul is one of a kind. Loved learning about him through so many perspectives.","Professor Nasrallah is a great lecturer, the material is fascinating, the discussions are invigorating, the class is challenging- you read a variety of extremely interesting texts, you touch on politics, history, theology, sexuality, everything!","No matter what your faith background, this class has something to offer you.  This course helps you think about how the letters of Paul, a central aspect of Christian tradition, have had an impact on YOU and the culture you live in.  If an atheist like Nietzsche can write so elegantly and passionately about St. Paul, you know Paul is worth learning about."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 46","course_id":"11231","cat_num":"8015","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 46","course_id":"11231","cat_num":"8015","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
