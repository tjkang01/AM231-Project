You jump right into MHG and start translating texts straight away. There is a lot of focus on grammar and historical linguistics.","Make sure that you understand what it going on at each step along the way (especially with regards to the linguistics\/grammar) and reach out to Prof. Kirakosian who is more than ready to meet and help! The more you engage with the readings and collaborate with other members of the class, the more rewarding your experience will be. Thorough preparation for weekly seminars makes all the difference!","If you're interested in medieval literature and only have familiarity with texts such as the Canterbury Tales or Beowulf, consider taking Middle High German and familiarizing yourself with a rich corpus of literature.","the title says it all: MHG for absolute beginners. Take advantage of this rare opportunity and learn more about the literature of medieval Germany"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"5.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GERMAN 200","course_id":"13409","cat_num":"135718","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"GERMAN 200","course_id":"13409","cat_num":"135718","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
