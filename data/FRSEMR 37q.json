While a couple of readings were substantially more difficult than others, they all contributed to a coherent narrative that changed my perspective on Jews and Judaism."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["If you are a student that would like to develop his\/her Jewish identity more, or wants to learn more about one of the most influential and pivotal religions of history, this course is for you, covering many of the most important thinkers of Jewish history.","This is a great freshman seminar!  You get a really great understanding of the development of Jewish thought throughout history, and Professor Cohen is awesome.  You definitely don't need to be Jewish to take this class, either, but be prepared to do a decent amount of reading if you want to get as much out of the class that you can.","Not very difficult and the readings and discussions are interesting."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"1.75","difficulty":"1.75","recommendation":"4.25","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 37q","course_id":"1845","cat_num":"31669","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 37q","course_id":"1845","cat_num":"31669","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 37q","course_id":"1845","cat_num":"31669","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
