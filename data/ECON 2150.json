However, it is very much a work in progress. Expect great ideas and interesting methods. Don't expect it to be taught in a structured or coherent way.","This is a very interesting course on how to apply machine learning techniques profitably to the social sciences. As the course syllabus states clearly, this is not a technical introduction to machine learning. For that, the best bet is the intro ML classes in the Comp Si dept. Nevertheless, this course is extremely useful. Sendhil gives thought-provoking lectures on ML in the social sciences that I found to be most helpful and, indeed, inspiring. I would enthusiastically recommend this course to anyone in the social sciences who has a good stats background and who wants to apply ML techniques in their research. In the F2014 iteration of this course, the TF (Jann) also gave section lectures that I would heartily recommend as well.","The class is new and felt a bit scattered, but it presented useful material and I'm very glad I took it.","Great class if you want a fresh view on econometrics and be exposed to big data problems","This course helps develop a conceptual understanding of big data. Lots of cool research is discussed. Sendhil is fun to listen to, and Jann is a very helpful TF."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This course provides a good introduction to machine learning, but the first half of the course (loss decomposition and the actual algorithms) could be learned on one's own (there are good lectures online from the NBER summer institute).  The second half of the course is very good.","It's an excellent way to get an understanding of what ML promises and can achieve"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"5.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"24","response rate":"54.17","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 2150","course_id":"12268","cat_num":"156429","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"6","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 2150","course_id":"12268","cat_num":"156429","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
