for beginner Amharic) and the small class size makes it fun.

The greatest improvement I have seen while taking this class is my ability to understand spoken Amharic.  In addition, students work with written material so they learn how to read and write passages in Amharic."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["The Amharic class here is great for learning how to both speak and write the language.

The knowledge of the language I have gained in this class has been very rewarding."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["Only take this class if you have a string interests in Ethiopian culture as well, or else you will not get as much out of the class.","I have learned an incredible amount from this class.

I appreciated how easy-going it was but maybe if I had to learn a little more during the semester I wouldn't have felt like the final was a nasty shock or that I learned about as much as I could have learned in three weeks but spent three months doing it."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This class (most African languages at Harvard, I hear) need serious restructuring and legitimacy!  I love the program and the encouragement of the prospect of African languages being teachable.

The course is difficult, but totally do-able. You will be challenged, but just enough.","Amharic was my favorite class this semester. The coursework was very light and I enjoyed doing it.

I'll definitely be taking the course again."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Amharic is an incredible language, with complexities that educators and scholars are only beginning to fully understand.

He's approachable and goes above and beyond.","Its a great class if you are interested in Ethiopian language and culture!","Taking Amharic with Mulugeta was perhaps my academic highlight of the semester. He is such a kind and genuine man and I feel truly grateful to have gotten to know him through our class this semester. I feel like I learned a great deal. While the language is a bit difficult, because the course was so personalized, I feel that I was able to take ownership over my learning experience. I highly recommend the class."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Mulugeta is one of the most endearing people I have ever met. The course and the language are incredibly interesting. Despite the somewhat challenging nature of the language, I always feel incredibly supported throughout the learning process. I would highly recommend the course.","If you have any interest in Amharic, its literature, or its people, there is absolutely no reason why you should not take advantage of Harvard's African Language Program. With time and effort, you will learn, and you will have the privilege to meet the brilliant, engaged, and fun teacher, Mulugeta."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This course is a great start to learning Amharic. The class is very chill and doable-- I took it as a fifth class and it can be done. The workload is light and manageable, so anybody can add this to their schedule and dive in. Mulugeta is hilarious and really engaging as a teacher. Definitely take this class!","If you have any interest in learning Amharic--a challenging and worthwhile pursuit--absolutely take it at Harvard. Not only does the African Languages Program have great infrastructure toward your language acquisition, Mulugeta is a phenomenal teacher who might even become a life-long friend.","It's a wonderful immersion into a beautiful language and culture, and Mulugeta is there to kindly guide you throughout the way. You will learn a lot quite quickly!","Mulugeta is one of the most wonderful teachers I've ever had. His warmness and true investment in his students' lives truly sets his class apart from any others I have taken at Harvard.","Professor Mulugeta is THE BEST please take Amharic you won't regret it - the language of nearly 100 million people, and Mulugeta makes memorizing hundreds of Amharic fidel easy."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Amharic year 1 was a wonderful introduction to the Ethiopian language. Mulugeta is an amazing teacher and will go out of his way to ensure you understand the language and do well in this class.","You must actually be invested in learning the language, because it is so different from English. It won't be easy in the same way an intro Spanish class is.","This is a great language class. Mulugeta makes this class so good.","Its a great class.
