You definitely get more out of it if you do the readings before class and think through some questions. Anne is very encouraging about giving feedback and taking time to provide constructive comments.","Go to class ready to toss around ideas about the readings, or it'll be pretty dull for yourself and everyone else.","This is a great class on international security! The class covers major topics (e.g. civil-military relations, nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction), but also includes topics like cyberwarfare and gender & international relations. Prof. Anne Sartori both a great researcher and educator. By that, I mean that she is both really knowledgeable of the literature in IR, but is also great at helping students understand the work and make connections. Ultimately though, the goal of the course is to equip students to be producers of knowledge in the field of IR. This goal is achieved through the weekly discussion papers, as well as the final project proposal."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"7.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"7","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 2830","course_id":"12418","cat_num":"156510","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 2830","course_id":"12418","cat_num":"156510","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
