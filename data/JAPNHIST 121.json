The discussions I had with my classmates were also very interesting.","This is a really great and interesting class that talks about women and gender in East Asia from pre-modern times until about 1945. I have personally developed a lot of discussion  leading and presentation skills based on this class. Professor Kawai is also very helpful and easy to get along with, making this class a pleasant and helpful experience. The topics very widely from week to week, and I feel like I have a more comprehensive understanding of histories of women in East Asia."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"5.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"4","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"JAPNHIST 121","course_id":"13488","cat_num":"160511","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"JAPNHIST 121","course_id":"13488","cat_num":"160511","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
