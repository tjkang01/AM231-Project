They will teach you to think and work in a different way than any other department at Harvard. But you will also only get as much as you put in when it comes to studio art classes; if you aren't willing to put in a significant amount of time outside of class each week, you will struggle to keep up with assignments and may not get as much out of the experience.","A background in 3-dimensional art (surprisingly) would have been incredibly helpful for this course. Although the class is marketed as a fundamentals course, Katarina and Melissa have very clear favorites for whom they dedicate a lot more time and energy, and these unfortunately happen to be the more experienced students in the class.","This isn't exactly a drawing course - it is heavily based in 3D object making.","Take this course only if you're genuinely interesting in exploring another type of learning and really just using a different part of your brain. It is very time consuming, but so worth it if you really explore work that you're interested in. It's not really a drawing course. So if that is what you are looking for, you should take the fall course. Still, it's a really cool course that allows you to explore abilities that you may not have known you had. Be open-minded!","TAKE IT."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"7.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"16","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 11BR","course_id":"13739","cat_num":"160236","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"8","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 11BR","course_id":"13739","cat_num":"160236","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
