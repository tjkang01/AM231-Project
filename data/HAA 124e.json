The readings are very, very dull and long. The professor usually assigns an entire book (+300 pages), plus other medium-long readings. There are no class discussions, except the discussions that take place during final presentations. Overall, people tend to focus on the final paper and give little attention to the other readings."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.88","difficulty":"2.88","recommendation":"4.12","enrollment":"9","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 124e","course_id":"2559","cat_num":"26493","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 124e","course_id":"2559","cat_num":"26493","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 124e","course_id":"2559","cat_num":"26493","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
