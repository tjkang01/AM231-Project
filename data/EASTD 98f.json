The two greatest strengths of the course for me were 1. academically, providing me with an excellent perspective on the field and many of the common pitfalls to be avoided in exploring it  and 2. personally\/practically, introducing me, as a first-year graduate student, to more than half a dozen of Harvard's best East Asian specialists, with whom I may work in the future.","This is primarily a reading\/discussion based class, and therefore the requirements are pretty minimal (80-120 pages of reading\/week, six short abstracts and one final paper).  We learned a lot about how scholars have approached the study of East Asian religions, which was quite interesting as their methodologies have varied tremendously. You will leave the course with a new framework for understanding the East, and it might push you to reevaluate how you conceptualize the humanities and social sciences (it did for me).  There were six professors who talked with us about their given specialties over the thirteen weeks, and I really enjoyed the intimate class dynamics and personal attention. I recommend it highly."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This course is great for anyone looking to gain a deeper understanding of East Asian religions. Professor Robson is fantastic. He's knowledgeable and approachable, and clearly loves what he teaches. It's a shame that there aren't more classes at Harvard in the field of East Asian religions.","you won't sweat too much, but the material will grip and challenge you. Robson is enlightening.","I would recommend this class to any student who is planning to concentrate in East Asian Studies.  This was a great junior tutorial, that challenged me to think about East Asian religions from different views."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.86","workload":"2.29","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.71","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EASTD 98f","course_id":"827","cat_num":"94577","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EASTD 98f","course_id":"827","cat_num":"94577","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EASTD 98f","course_id":"827","cat_num":"94577","1s":"2","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
