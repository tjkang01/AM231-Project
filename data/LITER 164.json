Great selection of readings and interesting class discussions, though the discussions could have been better if students had gotten more involved in them. However, I feel like I could have gotten much more out of this class had I had more general knowledge of eastern European history as well as more experience reading within the cannon.","The readings are totally amazing. The actual class discussion is only ok, but if you do the work, you can make it better.","Every single book you read in this class is incredible and most aren't ones you would hear of otherwise.  The workload outside of reading is of only moderate difficulty.  Prof. Grabowicz is very knowledgeable.","Be prepared to do quiet a bit of reading.  You will be expected to discuss a different novel every week.  Grabowicz is an extremely rewarding instructor if you take his space-cadet nature in stride -- he once assigned a short paper that was not on the syllabus in the middle of a musing on Kafka.  Be prepared for sudden changes that are decided on in class; if you miss a class be sure to have someone bring you up to speed.","Read the books. They're thick, literarily speaking, so no free riding in this class. And before this class, so some reading in canonical modernism. It will be helpful in comparative discussions. Know something about Russian literary heritage too. We don't read much from there, but it sure comes up a lot. You can get by without any of that tho. This class does tend to stick to the books at hand and it might have been the class makeup from my year that uniquely directed discussions in a particular direction.","The reading is dense and takes a long time, but very necessary to read before the class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.80","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AESTH&INTP 60","course_id":"623","cat_num":"7762","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AESTH&INTP 60","course_id":"623","cat_num":"7762","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AESTH&INTP 60","course_id":"623","cat_num":"7762","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
