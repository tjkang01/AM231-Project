I really don't think there's anything else to say. He's brilliant, warm, and, best of all, funny. What more could you want?","Look, there are are opportunities that come up really once in your life.  This is one of them.  This is learning about Vichy from someone who lived it.","Professor Higonnet brings a personal touch to this obscure party of world history. He leads excellent discussions on this very interesting subject. The best history course I have taken at this school.","Great class on an overlooked period of history. Great insight from Prof Higonnet. Good overview of the writings and historiography on Vichy. Good mix of military, political, social history, films. etc. Good personal stories and anecdotes. Nice relaxed historical discussions."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.83","workload":"2.17","difficulty":"3.17","recommendation":"4.83","enrollment":"8","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 82c","course_id":"2359","cat_num":"8154","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 82c","course_id":"2359","cat_num":"8154","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 82c","course_id":"2359","cat_num":"8154","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
