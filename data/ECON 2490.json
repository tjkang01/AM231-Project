You get to interact with world-renowned speakers (world leaders, great thinkers, practitioners) over a delicious meal at the Harvard Faculty Club every week, in addition to meeting economics students at the College and graduate programs and members of the national security community.","There are few courses at HKS that provide access to the decision makers of our time like Economics and National security","Apply for this unique opportunity to hear powerful narratives on global security.  It leverages the convening power of Harvard (and Prof. Feldstein) to bring in true global leaders in each of the subjects.  Plan extra time after each session to get to know the amazing cohort that forms to take this course.","Great course."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This is an incredible class in terms of the speakers and discussion topics - something that your average college student doesn't get to experience regularly.","This is an excellent course that, if you put the time in with the readings and engage with the speakers during the questions portion, is extremely valuable to anyone interested in the intersection of economics and national security.","Fascinating discussions bringing many different views together.","This is a class that you will remember for the rest of your life. You get to meet some of the world's largest decision-makers and thinkers, and speak to them directly and extensively about their fields. Prof. Feldstein's humor and wisdom makes the dinners so smooth and informative.
