But the historical and theoretical questions it addresses are extremely relevant to the study of medieval through renaissance to twentieth-century literature. The development of knowledge-systems, the semiotics of literature and film, issues of literary affect (wonder, belief etc) are just some of the things this course makes one think about.","This class is an incredible--and incredibly fun--exploration at a subject deeply relevant to literary, historical, and cultural studies.  You will be very glad that you took it!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.40","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"8","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 292m","course_id":"11301","cat_num":"23609","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 292m","course_id":"11301","cat_num":"23609","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 292m","course_id":"11301","cat_num":"23609","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
