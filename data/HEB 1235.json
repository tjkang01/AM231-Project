I'm not all that passionate about stone tools, though. Definitely better than SLS16 from what I've heard, if you need that req for HEB!","This was the first year for this course, so I think it will only continue to improve. Christian and Bridget were both great lecturers with a wealth of knowledge and a great sense of humor. Some of the readings are a little dense, but there are some greta opportunities to interact with artifacts in the Peabody collections and even make stone tools. Overall a good elective.","This course can be an interesting introduction to the methods and problems of studying early hominid history, but, if you don't have the patience to decode length readings on genetics and stone tools, it can be trying."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"3.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
