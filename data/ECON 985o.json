Your TF is a great resource for all those stupid questions you don't want to ask your advisor, and the deadlines they give you alleviate your stress by A LOT in the spring semester.","The second half of the thesis tutorial - the main reason for the difficulty is simply the difficulty in writing a thesis. This course is beneficial in that it gives you another set of experienced eyes to help guide you through the process.","Write a thesis if you have a topic, method, or adviser that's interesting to you!
