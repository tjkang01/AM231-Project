And this course is a great way to learn the challenging field as an undergraduate.","A really fun class with loads of interesting material. Reminded me why I wanted to study physics.","This class is superbly taught and presents very interesting physics, focusing on deep, underlying principles. It may not be applicable to all fields, but I think for those considering grad school and uncertain of their potential field, this is a perfect way to see if you like AMO. And after this course, you probably will.","This was definitely the best class I've taken in 4 years at Harvard.  It was difficult enough to be really interesting but moved at a pace that made sure that everyone kept up, it was extremely well-taught, the problem sets genuinely helped to make the material understandable, and the midterm and final oral exam were fair and accurate assessments of what you had learned.  I enjoyed going to every class and doing the problem sets.","This class was my first exposure to physics beyond the standard 15, 143 sequence. It was a great way to see interesting applications of what I had learned previously, and was in general just a fun way to spend an hour and a half every Tuesday and Thursday."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.83","recommendation":"4.83","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHYSICS 165","course_id":"4109","cat_num":"16952","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PHYSICS 165","course_id":"4109","cat_num":"16952","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHYSICS 165","course_id":"4109","cat_num":"16952","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
