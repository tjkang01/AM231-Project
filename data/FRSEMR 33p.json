Moreover, she is very approachable and lucid in explanations. That being said, the course is a seminar. I found that the quality of discussions depended highly on how committed everyone was to doing the readings. After a few weeks, it seemed like this quality and commitment dwindled until people just zoned out."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.10","workload":"1.20","difficulty":"2.10","recommendation":"3.20","enrollment":"11","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 33p","course_id":"10810","cat_num":"36493","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"5","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 33p","course_id":"10810","cat_num":"36493","1s":"3","2s":"4","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 33p","course_id":"10810","cat_num":"36493","1s":"9","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
