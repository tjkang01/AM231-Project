The assignments are useful and helped me grow as a writer because of Healy-Clancy's feedback. Would highly recommend.","Meghan is one of the strongest instructors I have had in my entire Harvard experience! She is really quick with feedback (again, one of the fastest, if not the fastest I've had) and she is great at narrowing in on your strengths and obstacles as a writer. She has a genuine enthusiasm about teaching and really talking about the content and it makes class the more enjoyable. Also the class is great at giving you all types of materials to work with and does well to capture the essence of different african countries."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90aw","course_id":"10961","cat_num":"67546","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90aw","course_id":"10961","cat_num":"67546","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90aw","course_id":"10961","cat_num":"67546","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
