Take only if you have a genuine passion for reinforcement learning and are interested in reading about cutting edge research in the field (and presumably ultimately contributing to it)","GOOD","Best CS class I have taken at Harvard. Finale's teaching is unmatched. RL is really cool!!","I'd recommend this students to anyone with an interest in reinforcement learning. Most of the class involved reading and discussing important papers in the field. It isn't overbearing, all of the assignments felt very worthwhile, and I felt like I left with a general understanding of the field.","psets require lots of time, material is difficult but class is chill. this class takes way more time than ordinary seminar course, so be prepared.","A bit harder than other seminar courses, but interesting material makes it worth it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"9.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"15","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPSCI 282R","course_id":"12880","cat_num":"156936","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"5","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPSCI 282R","course_id":"12880","cat_num":"156936","1s":"2","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
