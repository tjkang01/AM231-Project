You need a lot of it for a good talk. Also, come for the class and support your classmates\/peers.","basically you're screwed if the \"committee\" knows anything about you. then they reject papers on topics you're interested in if it falls remotely close to your research interest. add on top of that the fact that some people get away with presenting papers on their research and others never show up to journal club and still pass and basically you can get away with anything. it makes it frustrating to the people who actually go because we're \"supposed\" to."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["It is a fun and a great learning experience both listening to the talks as well as preparing for it.","This is probably the most fun 'class' you'll see."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["It's super useful.","Start working on this a full 3 weeks before your presentation.

They'll enjoy it more. But don't try tooo hard.","Presentations waver in quality. Occasionally, you will have a complete disaster where the presenter doesn't know what he or she is talking about, and seemingly offends every living person with jokes that seem like they're from a sitcom 5 years past it's prime (including jokes about a sitcom 5 years past its prime). More vetting needs to done with jokes to make sure they are actually... funny. Perhaps they should bar papers that have pretty obvious leads to offensive material.\r\n\r\nYou're actual presentation is just two weeks of not getting other stuff done.","Plan ahead and be confident! Don't go up there thinking you're going to fail, that kills presentations.","You have to take it.","The presentations are hit or miss.","Take this class seriously. Put in effort and you will learn a lot. Read the papers before coming. Turn your brain on.","Take it seriously and you will reap rewards! Don't treat it like a chore or something scary, have fun with it and really do a good job.

When he turns up.","Its one of the best parts of the MCO program and something you should attend even beyond the required 2 years.","I think journal club is great.

Although faculty coaching might be an issue, I think the problem is really in the effort the students put in. Many talks look like they were cobbled together the night before and the analysis were superficial at best. \r\n\r\nThat said, there are still many stellar presentations.
