It also raises lots of important and interesting questions about new ways to study and present history\/anthropology. The course definitely had an experimental feeling, which could be quite frustrating: the experimental nature often seemed to allow everyone (profs, students) to take it a little less seriously than they might a more traditional seminar. The final project can take up as much time as you want it to--those with design\/cs skills will take it in a very different direction than the anthro grad students, for example. Professors Gordon and Bestor made seminar feel collegial, which was reassuring, though at times their unfamiliarity with the more technical side of things made for slow going in class. This sometimes came at the expense of more in-depth engagement with the content of the course.","This was an incredible course, and I encourage students without existing links to the history and anthropology departments (like myself) to shop it.  This course reshaped the way I form an academic argument & how I consider my source material.  The sheer volume of constructive feedback I got during the semester from the course staff & my peers was almost absurd. \r\n\r\nProfessor Gordon & Professor Bestor are absolutely charming individuals & are the most knowledgeable, passionate, and connected human beings in this subject matter, and it was an honor to study under them for this semester.  Also, the TF, Kyle Parry, is incredibly insightful, understanding and articulate.  These three individuals complemented each other well.","This course is really fun, and both Professors are amazing. You will get to be at the forefront of new learning and explore new technologies unlike just about any other humanities course at Harvard. Highly recommended."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1923","course_id":"10937","cat_num":"84534","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1923","course_id":"10937","cat_num":"84534","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1923","course_id":"10937","cat_num":"84534","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
