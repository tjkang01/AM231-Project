If you like a clear road map and structure it might not be for you as this course is as much about figuring out what a class on ancestry could be about than it is about the subject matter itself. Keep in mind that it's also a class about how to teach. This is not a conventional seminar course.","Take it for Prof. Jasanoff. She is BRILLIANT and so passionate about teaching.","Great exercise in pedagogy","This class explores the topic from a wide range of vantage points and can be very fulfilling if you take the trouble to wrestle with each approach.","This class was a great experience and gave fantastic insight into the challenges that professors face. Being in class with Professor Jasanoff is always a great deal of fun (and is  quite challenging!), and I think the topic of ancestry is an important one to explore and to understand."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"4.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"8","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 2224","course_id":"13942","cat_num":"161185","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 2224","course_id":"13942","cat_num":"161185","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
