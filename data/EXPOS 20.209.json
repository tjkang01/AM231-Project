But this was a particularly good course","The writing assignments for this class are very time consuming; the standards for the essays are very high.  The preceptor is often confusing, opinionated, and somewhat rude in her comments on essays.","This is a very difficult class that involves a lot of work.","Go for it if you find Orientalism a thought-provoking topic. Otherwise, avoid this class! It's really challenging to write about this topic, and I spent many frustrating (and unrewarding) hours trying to figure it out.","This class will help your writing but is particularly useful if you have an interest in the humanities and the subject matter.","The grading's pretty tough. The material is interesting but that's about it.","Expos has the potential to be a really great course. The preceptor Justine makes it the worst experience of your life.","I would tell students to take it if they are interested in Orientalism and if they have experience analyzing film."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.46","workload":"2.62","difficulty":"3.46","recommendation":"3.15","enrollment":"14","response rate":"92.86","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.209","course_id":"1741","cat_num":"40963","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 20.209","course_id":"1741","cat_num":"40963","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"7","4s":"6","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.209","course_id":"1741","cat_num":"40963","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"7","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
