The trips that we took, combined with Ted's interesting background as a museum curator, did a lot to generate enthusiasm for the class.","This class was so much fun! You learn so much about the history and culture of Boston! You get to travel to different museums and buildings in Boston.","It interesting and applicable","There is barely any work and you are able to have a quick snap shot of all the most famous artists that came from the East Coast and particularly Boston and the best part is that we went to the museums or around Harvard and were able to see the paintings which we talked about in class.","THIS CLASS IS AMAZING!","if you like art and Boston, this course does it all."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["The class is great.  Professor Stebbins is a wonderful teacher, just make sure you do the work.  The \"TF\" Francesco was great as well.  A good course for this interested in Art History and want to try it out.","TAKE THIS COURSE! Professor Stebbins is a wonderful teacher. He is unbelievably sharp and his discussions and interpretations are always spot on. He has gone out of his way to get to know each and every one of us as students and as individuals. \r\nThe workload is very light - with good readings and meaningful (yet short) assignments. \r\nAnybody who is interested in the history of Harvard and Boston or has an interest in visual arts in the class will LOVE this course. This course will provide you with the information you need to speak intelligently about art on Harvard's campus (there's a lot more than you think) and about American art in general. I am thrilled that I decided to take this course and cannot recommend it highly enough."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"1.50","difficulty":"2.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"4","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 39s","course_id":"1857","cat_num":"23719","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 39s","course_id":"1857","cat_num":"23719","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 39s","course_id":"1857","cat_num":"23719","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
