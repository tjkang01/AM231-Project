It deals less with immigration policy and focuses on the groups of interest in the current immigration literature (e.g., Mexican, Arab, West Indian, etc.). If your interest in immigrations is more directed towards those topics and populations, this class provides a nice overview of the current literature."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This is a great course!

Had students from different schools, so a lot of different viewpoints were brought to the table. Professor Waters is great!","This course will open your eyes to an incredibly important, emergent subfield; the reading list is fantastic, the instructor is at the top of the field.","To me, it really only makes sense to take if you are very very interested in immigrant assimilation.
