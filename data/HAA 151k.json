That said, you absolutely do not need to be an HAA concentrator. But a willingness to participation is essential. What is not required though is in-depth knowledge of the material\/period, which Professor Fehrenbach brings to the table in a clear and enlightening way. Absolutely recommended for anyone interested in Renaissance Art.","Good introduction to artists and issues of the period, very heavy on visual analysis","Take this course!  I rarely recommend the courses I take, but this one I recommend without any reservations.  Every component of this course is engaging.  The readings are really interesting and totally manageable and the assignments are not busy work - they actually help you develop as an art scholar\/critic.  Plus, now you can walk into a museum and like it!  This course challenges you to think visually and profoundly expands your understanding of Italian art.  In short, you'll leave with new eyes.","This class is both exceedingly interesting and remarkably fun.  Professor Fehrenbach is a remarkably intelligent man, and the in-class exercises are fantastic: using Leonardo da Vinci's Paragone, we had to debate whether painting or poetry was the finer art.","Professor Fehrenbach is great! Full of knowledge but also very kind and gentle. You'll see Renaissance art in a whole new light - or at least, I got to appreciate it a whole lot more.","A fun seminar with free flowing discussions"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"10","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 151k","course_id":"2567","cat_num":"3100","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 151k","course_id":"2567","cat_num":"3100","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"10","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 151k","course_id":"2567","cat_num":"3100","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
