It is thus desirable to delve into this painful topic and to get a better understanding for all the various factors involved and archaeology definitely has a lot of light to shed on it. The main reason why I would recommend this class is the professor who makes this class such an edifying experience with his great erudition and his passion not only for archaeology but for all the other sciences involved in the study of ancient cultures.","This is a great class and a thorough investigation of warfare in the ancient Near East. Both archaeology, anthropology, and strategy\/tactics are discussed, making this class holistic and interesting. If you're interested in warfare and history at all, I highly recommend taking this course!","This class is great, for those with extensive knowledge or those, like me, who are just starting out in the field. One of the best courses I've taken at Harvard."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANE 219","course_id":"13648","cat_num":"159979","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANE 219","course_id":"13648","cat_num":"159979","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
