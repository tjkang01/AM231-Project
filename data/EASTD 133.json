It has helped me to think about China and Chineseness in new ways; that is, thinking about it beyond \"culture\", and rather towards historical and anthropological interpretations. I really appreciated how this class helped me to think about ancient, modern, and contemporary China-- to see what has been continuous, but also in picking apart the discontinuities.The readings take a lot of time, but I think it was worth it.","Do the reading, participate actively in class, don't be intimidated by grad students, and you will do well. Very interesting materials, but expect to leave with more questions than answers about identity formation and Chineseness.","Not very much guidance in the course - don't take if you are looking to learn about something you don't already have a grounding in.","Students should be wary of uttering the (actually, one would have thought, rather nuanced, theoretically well-grounded, and complex) word \"identity\" - no mean feat in a course about \"Chinese-ness\" where identity-related issues are pretty central. Rather, the unwieldy \"identity processes\" should be substituted to avoid a protracted and automatic polemic on the theoretical emptiness of the concept of \"identity\". \r\n\r\nEnterprising students may wish to save time by issuing a disclaimer at the very beginning of the semester indicating (as have many well-respected academics before them) that what exactly they mean when they do say \"identity\" IS \"identity processes\" and that they don't mean to automatically assume that \"identity\" is static, &c. &c., but I would not encourage them to get their hopes up that this careful introduction will be heeded. Bow to inevitability and accept that \"identity processes\" is the official lingua franca and flavor of the month."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.78","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.44","recommendation":"3.78","enrollment":"11","response rate":"81.82","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EASTD 133","course_id":"836","cat_num":"62146","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"7","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EASTD 133","course_id":"836","cat_num":"62146","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EASTD 133","course_id":"836","cat_num":"62146","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"5","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
