You will watch some great movies and begin to see them in ways you would not have before. Oft is fantastic and is really excited about the subject matter.","Fun and easy class, but having to watch a movie every week was more of a time commitment than I thought it would be.","Anyone who is willing to have their opinions challenged and who wants to learn about law's incredibly crucial influence in our lives should take this course. Also anyone who enjoys a good movie and wants to become a critical movie viewer."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["This class is a lot of fun, but it requires a lot of work. In addition to the movies, you have to read about 50 pages of socio-legal scholarship. These reads are very interesting, but they are often high level. Professor Liviatan will push you in class to discuss and cite the readings, so doing them is crucial. Though the class is pass\/fail, she ensures that you are really engaged during class by making the course relevant and the discussion engaging.","Just know movies take up more time than you would think, also final project paper should be considered.","3 hours work is misrepresentative because the movie takes 2","Enjoyable experience, built strong connection with professor","Professor Liviatan is very knowledgeable and passionate about teaching students, so I would recommend taking this course just to get to know her.","Ofrit is super enthusiastic and you do get a good sense of various legal arguments and the ways societies are shaped. The films are (almost) all really engaging and I hadn't seen any of them before","There is a lot of hard legal information with an assumption of background knowledge that many of us didn't have. The Sunday noon deadlines for worksheets were also killer."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"3.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"12","response rate":"91.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 40E","course_id":"13549","cat_num":"160785","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"5","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 40E","course_id":"13549","cat_num":"160785","1s":"1","2s":"9","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
