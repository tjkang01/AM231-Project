As an undergraduate, the reading at first can seem a bit daunting, but the subjects are fascinating. I'd recommend the course.","This is not a class for someone with only casual interest in the subject.  You need to be passionate about American history and ready to engage in challenging intellectual discussion, otherwise you will likely not get much out of the course.  Likewise, doing the readings is an absolute must--especially don't skimp on the book readings, which provide a larger narrative structure for the course.  That said, there are field trips in lieu of regular section meetings, which help you get to know the religious history of Boston and can be great fun even if not always directly related to course material.","The subject matter is interesting, and there's definitely some stuff to talk about. But unless this class has been considerably reorganized and primary sources added, I wouldn't bother taking it."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["I think that this is a really interesting class, that can be great if students come to class having done the readings AND are prepared to contribute. Studying Protestants and Catholics and the dynamics between them is a really provocative way to go about studying American history. The field trips to the JFK Library and Somerville Library was so informative and really fun!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"10.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"2","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 1480","course_id":"5076","cat_num":"108207","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RELIGION 1480","course_id":"5076","cat_num":"30174","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 1480","course_id":"5076","cat_num":"108207","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
