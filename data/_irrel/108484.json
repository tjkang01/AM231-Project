Take it take it take it take it take it (but it won't be offered again; too bad for you!)","A great course that gave me both an overview and specific knowledge about queer history and queer theory. Focusing on one book\/reading a week was an extraordinary way of learning and thinking about queer thought. Downsides: kind of unfortunately focused on white people, especially white people in Britain; it would have been nice to have more readings from queer of color theory. Other downside: I don't think Prof. Abelove is ever teaching it again :(","Fantastic seminar on sexuality, which is almost impossible to find at Harvard. I hope WGS invests more in courses like this in the future.","This is an incredible class. Although I'm not sure what the class would be like without Professor Abelove...\r\nThat being said, the basis of the class is strong and the seminar format encourages thoughtful participation.","This class was incredible- it's a pity that Prof. Abelove is retiring, because he was an incredible teacher and an incredible listener.  Truly a must take class, an eye opening experience."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.86","workload":"2.43","difficulty":"3.43","recommendation":"4.86","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"WOMGEN 1459","course_id":"4933","cat_num":"51355","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"WOMGEN 1459","course_id":"4933","cat_num":"51355","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"WOMGEN 1459","course_id":"4933","cat_num":"51355","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
