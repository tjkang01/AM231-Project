It was also really chill, only 3 projects, not very time consuming (except the day before the critiques). I totally recommend to anyone for a fun elective, or VES studio requirement. I particularly loved learning how to use the woodshop.","This was a great class to explore your artistic voice and to find different materials to do so. I do think this class would be very different with a different teacher - so keep that in mind!","So fun"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"2.70","difficulty":"2.70","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"7","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 31","course_id":"11268","cat_num":"68921","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 31","course_id":"11268","cat_num":"68921","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 31","course_id":"11268","cat_num":"68921","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
