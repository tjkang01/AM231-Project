There isn't a ton of structure to the course, so you'll have to do a lot of it yourself.","One of the best classes I took at Harvard if not the best.  Don't know if it will be the same next year with a new teacher but it is awesome to take classes at other schools.","Fantastic course, very relevant and very interesting. Learned a lot through student presentations - overall great course!","It was really interesting and fun to interact with some of the big personalities in this class.","Be prepared to do work\/readings on your own to keep up as there is not much hand-holding. Class discussion is very interesting.","Definitely consider taking this course if you are interested in European politics or economics (or both!); Mistral is an amazing professor."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.10","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"11","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 1187","course_id":"2216","cat_num":"55359","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 1187","course_id":"2216","cat_num":"55359","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"9","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 1187","course_id":"2216","cat_num":"55359","1s":"1","2s":"6","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
