This course really gives you the chance to take a subject or issue that you find interesting and then carry out your own research project, and this is great way to hone both your research skills and try out some potential ideas for a senior thesis. Also, Matt is like the best person ever, and he exemplifies what every effective instructor should be. Matt genuinely cares about the success and educational experience of his students, and it really does make a difference.","From my understanding, this course changes a lot from year to year depending on the instructor. However, during the year I took it,the course was extremely rewarding. It's a great opportunity to dive a little deeper into research and might help you decide whether or not you want to write a thesis."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOCIOL 96r","course_id":"11334","cat_num":"7425","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOCIOL 96r","course_id":"11334","cat_num":"7425","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOCIOL 96r","course_id":"11334","cat_num":"7425","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
