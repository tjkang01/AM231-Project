Do yourself a favor, and prioritize this class. Don't wait until the night before section to look at the primary source and skim a secondary source or two to do the response paper. I did that, and sorely regret it. You can get so much out of this class; don't waste it. It is a SHAME that Leonard Wood will not be around next year to teach this - you will miss out.","This course provides a broad introduction to many of the intellectual and political movements in the Middle East, which can sometimes be a bit frustrating.  Otherwise, you learn do a lot of readings and learn a lot.","This is the best class I have taken at Harvard. Leonard Wood is brilliant and will change everything you thought you knew about the Middle East and the world. Arafat is also brilliant and gives really helpful feedback on response papers! There are a lot of readings sometimes, but they are really engaging and it's worth it. Take this class, you won't regret it!","This class is a great way to learn history and provides an excellent understanding for understanding the Middle East. Professor Wood can be frustrating at times, but overall, this is a very well put together class.","It's a great class! You'll have to put up with a lot of work, analytics that works as often as they don't, and a stereotypical portrayal of the ME in a lot of ways, but you will learn a ton. Don't take it without a follow up class, especially something that discusses non-ideological cause and effect cases, like political economy or something. But really, very fun, very beneficial.","Professor Wood is such an excellent teacher, and I would take any course offered by him without reservation.","Dr. Wood is leaving and the course will not be the same without him. That said, if Ari is TFing again, the class is a must take. Be prepared to read extensively (skimming and prioritizing certain selections is a must) and attend every lecture - you will reap the rewards. I came out of this class learning more from a single class in a single semester than I have from entire semesters combined.","Do the primary source readings every week, and try to keep up on the secondary source material! It is all interesting, but abundant so it is easy to get overwhelmed. Stick with it and you will learn so much. Prof. Wood is an excellent lecturer, and is very knowledgeable about the material so don't be afraid to go to his OH and speak to him about anything. He is very approachable and helpful!","The lectures in this course are exemplary, the readings stimulating, and the class as whole challenges students to think relativistically and empathetically about the Middle East of the twentieth century, in a way particularly valuable for any Western observer.","If you want to learn a lot about the Middle East in one semester, this is the class for you. You will learn about the Middle East from an Arab perspective, learn to judge Arab intellectualism on its own merits, an underrated skill for government and history majors.","Awesome class! You learn so much about the complexities of the region and you really come to appreciate how little Westerners actually understand about the Middle East. One of the best classes I have taken at Harvard.","Professor Wood and the TF Ari were fantastic, and the material and lectures were fascinating, but the amount of reading is a bit onerous, especially with the response papers. I would recommend this class, although I found it somewhat difficult not having a lot of prior knowledge of modern Middle Eastern history.","The lectures are great and you will leave with a much better understanding of the Middle East. However, be prepared for a lot of reading and be willing to put the work into understanding the complexities of the primary sources the course examines."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.57","workload":"2.91","difficulty":"3.45","recommendation":"4.55","enrollment":"25","response rate":"88.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
