You will be given the opportunity to collaborate with Psychology Graduate students on their studies and facilitate scheduling and running participants.","Great course. Great way to get exposure to a lab and switch up the classic schedule of having 4 classes. Perfect class for people interested in psychology research and meeting cool people!"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Incredible learning experience along with not a huge amount of work load.","Great course!","The Gilbert lab is awesome! You work under a grad student on whatever line of research needs assistance. The expectations are totally fair and your designated time in the lab can easily be figured out to fit your schedule. If you're lucky like I was, though, most of your time will be spent outside the lab brainstorming\/researching ways to test your hypothesis and creating experiment stimuli. There are weekly journal club discussions where every RA reads the same article(s) and you discuss them as a lab. This helped the lab feel like a community and facilitated everyone getting to know each other and their work. Finally, rather than write a paper, the Gilbert lab has each RA give a PowerPoint presentation at the end of the semester to show Dan and the rest of the RAs and grad students what they worked on. This was a great capstone to an enjoyable semester. If you're thinking about working in a lab at some point, this is a fantastic option!","If you hope to get a better idea of how psychological experiments work and would like to get hands-on experience with data analysis, this is the course for you. Also if you loved SLS-20 with Gilbert, this is a great opportunity to interact with him and gain even more of his wisdom.","This is an excellent lab to be in if you are looking for a rigorous and hands-on, but extremely enjoyable experience with other great and highly motivated students. The lab grants students a lot more freedom than others on campus, but be prepared to hold your own and take a lot of initiative in the research process. Overall, I would highly recommend working here."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["One of the best things I have done at Harvard. Dan & David made my experience utterly worthwhile and I am so glad I did it.","If you want lab experience, I would highly recommend working at the gilbert lab. The hours are flexible and they have really interesting projects going on!","This lab is such a great way to engage with all aspects of the psychology research process that you hear about in other classes but do not always get to experience hands on. Working with data has been such a valuable way to gain a deeper understanding of psychology but also develop my quantitative skills that will serve me well in the world of business. It is also so inspiring to work under Professor Gilbert and many of the top up and coming psychologists. The lab is a lot of work, but it is also so much fun, and my lab group and I became such great friends throughout my years here.","This is definitely one of the best psych labs at Harvard. You're expected to work at a very high level and produce excellent work, but it's a really enjoyable experience and everyone in the lab is really great to work with."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["This lab is very good at preparing you for work in the real psychology world. It also gives you great exposure to Dan Gilbert while also giving you brilliant mentors in the grad students. Would recommend highly.","Great people and fun research!","You get great exposure to research with a great group of research assistants in the Gilbert Lab each semester. We always work on something new in Bethany's lab, and its great to get a range of experiences.","Working in the Gilbert Lab with David is a very rewarding experience. You are able to take an active part in fascinating research projects and see what the day-to-day life of a researcher is like. The meetings you have with the entire Gilbert Lab and Prof. Gilbert are inspiring and fascinating.","There is a high level of expectation in terms of prior knowledge and skill, but the workload is not that intense and you definitely learn a lot about how to actually conduct psychological research."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["Highly recommend the Gilbert lab if you're looking for a lab course. Low time commitment but good lab experience. The best part is the science fair at the end of the semester.","This class has been the cornerstone of my independent work at Harvard. I have learnt the highs and lows of being a post doc but also I have trained deeply in various lab techniques. Big plus in my book","Working with Bethany in the Gilbert lab is always enjoyable. If you are looking for research experience, don't hesitate to try out this lab."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["If you're a psych student considering a lab, definitely make it the Gilbert lab! A lot of my friends in other psych labs have to undergo brutal, menial work (like spend 10H+ coding videos), but this definitely isn't the case with Gilbert's lab: you're constantly doing meaningful, thoughtful work that actually impacts the course of your lab mentor's research. All the people in this lab are incredible too: unlike other labs, the post-grads you work with here are extremely down to earth and have an awesome sense of humor, so it makes every encounter with them enjoyable. Plus, every week, I honestly looked forward to days when I came to this lab to work on research, and my relationship with my lab mentor became one of the best mentor ships\/experiences I've had at Harvard. You really need to participate in this lab - I guarantee that you won't regret it!","You should definitely look into doing this for any sort of future research work just to get a gauge of what's going on in the lab.","this is a really unique course that lets you get real lab experience and work with cool post-docs on their experiments","even if it is not the exact research you are interested in, it is such a great experience and you get to know people\/professors that you can keep in touch with and help guide you with future decisions","Great way to get to see the in's on how psych studies work and also great way to get to know the guys in the lab, like Dan and David","This class is legitimately one of the best classes you can take at Harvard. You will learn a lot about the entire process of running studies and analyzing data in a super low stress and fun environment. The whole department is absolutely incredible, and working with Gus this semester was a ton of fun. He is an absolute homie, and I 100% recommend working with him.","TAKE THIS COURSE!! especially if you found SLS 20 enjoyable. The course is not a heavy time requirement at all. I used it as my fifth class and I absolutely loved it. You only meet about once or so a week, and you are able to get amazing hands on experience in psychology. Each of the mentors are amazing (especially Gus!) and are always willing to just chat about anything. Great great course. Will be taking it every year."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"6.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"14","response rate":"78.57","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 2580R","course_id":"4339","cat_num":"113780","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 2580r","course_id":"4339","cat_num":"4262","1s":"3","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 2580R","course_id":"4339","cat_num":"113780","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
