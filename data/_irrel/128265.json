Having said that, sometimes it can feel a little tedious having to review things like the imperfect and preterit tenses. I would recommend taking this course before 30, but if you're particularly confident in your skills, you might want to go straight to 30.","Italian is such a beautiful, yet easy-to-learn language. I strongly recommend going beyond the introductory levels and taking C because I feel infinitely more confident in my speaking and reading abilities because of this class.","A great course that solidifies necessary Italian grammar and vocab with emphasis on reading and verbal skills. Plus, you get to watch interesting Italian films!","This class is fun, but it is mostly review of what we learned in beginning Italian. There is a lot of class interaction, which makes for improved speaking and good friendships, but there is also a big focus on grammar that you already know. It would be a really good class if you weren't completely comfortable with Italian grammar or if you needed brushing up.","Take Italian C! If you've taken Italian Aa and Ab then don't let it go to waste! Keep going!!","Take this class, enjoy the movies, try to practice language with your friends out of class, and enjoy a beautiful language!"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["If you need a review of grammar, it's a great course.","Good review before you move onto higher levels of Italian. Laid back, manageable workload.","The course is great. It's mostly a review of first year Italian with more focus on conversation.","This is an amazing, fun Italian class! If you are really interested in learning Italian or have taken a class like Italian Acd though, this will feel a little slow (I do feel like a little more reading\/writing assignments would have helped my Italian a lot more). That said, it was a great learning experience!"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Italian C is great. It basically reinforces what you learned in Aa and Ab. Be prepared to manage your time efficiently - even if you're really good at Italian, that might be your downfall in this class.","A great class to continue exposure to Italian language and also culture. My favorite aspects of this course were the wide range of cultural elements employed to increase exposure to the language such as novels, films and music. Not quite as exciting as beginning Italian. Grammatically more intense\/stringent, but worth it if you are willing to put in the work and time on a consistent basis.","This was my first Italian class that was conducted only in Italian. I was apprehensive at first but after completing it, I understand why emersion is the best way to learn. The small size of the class also helped to encourage me to speak more.","This class is really fun and it really improves your Italian!","For me this class was fine because we had a great group in section, but I felt like the course itself was kind of disorganized and I wasn't a huge fan of the readings\/movies. It definitely helped to improve my understanding of the grammar, and I feel much better writing\/reading\/hearing Italian. My speaking didn't improve a TON, but that's more of a me problem than the class itself.","This class was fun, not too stressful with work out of class, but more emphasis could have been put on practicing verb conjugation, vocabulary, and other technical aspects of the language.  The class did do a great job of exposing us to Italian culture.","An excellent refresher of grammar, & overall, a great & fun class that uses a variety of dynamic teaching methods. You can get bogged down with a lot of outside work at times throughout the semester, but that's about as tough as the class gets.","This course is not terribly demanding, but its frequently trivial assignments can put a damper on productivity for other courses (especially for those with science-heavy schedules).  Essays, readings, and discussions were very useful in improving fluency in written and spoken Italian.  That the course is conducted in Italian is perhaps its greatest strength, as it requires you to be able to readily understand spoken Italian and to formulate coherent responses to questions more rapidly and with increasing fluency.","The first day of class, I thought I was not good enough at Italian to take the class. The thought of only speaking in Italian everyday horrified me. But it actually turned out really well. If you do the homework, the quizzes are easy, and the tests are just longer quizzes!","a lot of busy work (many assignments)","Rather badly run and I didn't learn much.","This is a good course to refresh yourself on all the grammatical concepts of Aa and Ab.  However, it is a lot more work than you would think.  Do not go into this course thinking it will be an easy A because unless your Italian is better than proficient, it won't be.  Be ready to read and watch movies more than you would anticipate.","Italian C does an excellent job of filling in the gaps in your Italian knowledge from when you took Italian Aa, Ab, or Acd.","Italian C won't teach you any new vocabulary or grammar. Your reading skills will definitely improve, and your writing skills might too. Overall though, not much is gained through this class that wasn't already taught in Aa\/Ab."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Good class, but a lot of work. Be prepared. But your Italian will certainly get better.","Great class! I took several years of public high school Italian before coming to Harvard and felt okay in terms of basic grammar and pretty good with speaking. This class is a great class to take if you want to review your grammar. It is also great for improving your speaking skills. Class is usually composed of a lot of back and forth speaking with the teacher and other students. Having said that, if you are not very comfortable with speaking and with listening to others speak, take Ab to get back into the swing of things, otherwise you may feel lost. Homework is very standard and quizzes are very fair.","For the large amount of work you put in to this class, it does not seem like your Italian improves as productively. Instead the numerous assignments can start to feel like busy work all together which is defeating because it does not feel like your Italian is improving at the same pace.","Italian C is a great way to brush up on your writing and speaking skills before moving into more advance courses! It's a really fun class full of fun discussions and material."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This is a great course to further your comprehension and speaking skills for Italian! You really deepen your understanding of idiomatic\/everyday Italian through the inclusion of media in the course (films, novels, short stories). Also, since the classes are small, you develop a great rapport with both your instructor and your classmates. It's not particularly grammar-heavy. but you review concepts when necessary to keep your writing strong. Also, Chris is a great instructor who creates a comfortable and fun environment to practice speaking Italian in.","It really just felt like a review of Italian Ab.","You likely won't learn much from this course. Some assignments will feel like busy work.","For those on the fence about continuing after Italian Ab, know that this class focuses less on the more annoying aspects like grammatical structures and is more about developing fluency.","Aside from the empowering experience of reading my first book in Italian and exposure to some cool Italian film, I found that I improved my Italian very little, if at all in this class. Trust your initial instincts when you shop this class.","Great course! Chris is a fantastic instructor and the use of movies and songs is a fun, effective way of teaching the language.","While you might never get assessed on grammar, this class does go over the more finer grammar points that will help you become more fluent in the Italian language. It has only a few writing assignments and sometimes the work resembles \"busy work\", but since it meets four times a week, your speaking is bound to approve, especially your confidence in discussing books and ideas. The work load is manageable, but lack of organization can make work appear magically some weeks.","It's great for students who have taken Italian before and want to refresh before they more on to advanced courses. Patrizia is Italian and really pulls from her experiences in Italy to help students understand the language on a deeper level. If you pay attention to the homework for the night and review the grammar points over the course of the semester, your Italian skills when improve a lot and you'll have a strong basis for continuing in the following courses.","it is definitely a transition course that helps you prepare from beginner to moderate italian efficiency.","Italian C with Professor Rodomonti is a fantastic learning experience. I originally took it to fulfill my language requirement, but this class has convinced me to continue learning Italian and to try to earn a citation in Italian. It's an incredible class without too much work that benefits you immensely in terms of your speaking skills in the language."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This class is a perfect, and moderately easy transition course into intermediate level italian.","A much more interesting and engaging Italian class than an introductory class with an appropriate level of review"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["You're Italian will definitely improve, but be ready to put in a fair amount of work if learning another language does not come naturally to you. There will be more work some weeks than others, so just be prepared to be flexible.","This is a very interactive class with room to make mistakes, fix them, and learn from them for the future.","This could be a good course but it lacks structure and a lot of the assignments are made up as the course goes on. That being said, it is a decent review of Italian if you want to continue into higher level Italian"]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["It C with Prof. Lieberman is probably one of the most enjoyable and productive classes I've ever been in.","This course is a good review of Italian grammar. Reading the novel improves fluency, and the movies were fun to watch. Peter was able to tailor the class to emphasize the things that we wanted to learn about, which made for an even more engaging experience.","This class is wonderful if you're interested in exploring Italian literary themes and reviewing grammar comprehensively. Vocab practice is a little patchy and requires individual work outside of the classroom."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This is a good class to solidify intermediate grammar and reading skills.","A great class to solidify Italian skills! You will be conversational by the end of the class, if not better. There seemed to be fewer students in the Spring than in the Fall, so you may want to consider that before enrolling."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["I loved Italian 20! This is the first language class that I have taken that I felt I was no longer simply learning the language, but applying my knowledge to reading comics and essays, and watching films. I definitely recommend this class for an intermediate Italian learner!","This class is a great introduction to Italian literature and really engages with the main styles and genres in a meaningful and productive way","molto compito","I would strongly recommend this course to my peers who are very interested in advancing their Italian language abilities. I would tell them that the course is not easy\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere is a considerable amount of homework (which is not meaningless, it was very helpful) and the course meets each day, which can be a significant time commitment for some. That said, i you are interested in learning a lot more about Italy and its culture, this course is a must!","It's a great way to learn Italian and elevate your facility with the language, but be prepared to work very hard, as it's a time-consuming class. Don't take during an otherwise-busy semester."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"10.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ITAL C","course_id":"4419","cat_num":"128265","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ITAL C","course_id":"4419","cat_num":"29891","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ITAL C","course_id":"4419","cat_num":"128265","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
