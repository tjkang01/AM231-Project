His Uighur is excellent, and his enthusiasm for the language and its culture is contagious. He uses the communicative approach, the most advanced pedagogy in language teaching, and makes the process of internalizing the language really easy and fun. I greatly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning  Uighur.","Fun, not too hard, awesome language to learn.","I tell everyone that this is my favorite course of the semester, because I was able to learn about the culture, history, and geography of Central Asia through this class. I felt like it opened up the entire region, and I feel like I am able to learn additional languages from this area with more ease. Further, in college, I was really lacking in confidence about my language learning abilities, and this class has made it a pleasure to learn a new language."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"6.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"4","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"UYGHUR A","course_id":"916","cat_num":"124106","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"UYGHUR A","course_id":"916","cat_num":"8767","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"UYGHUR A","course_id":"916","cat_num":"124106","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
