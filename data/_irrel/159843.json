It is taught extremely well and all of your needs are honestly catered to (which is what everyone wants and needs in a language class). You will have a great time!","Vassiliki Rapti is an inspiring and phenomenal instructor who is extremely generous in her commitment to her students.  The latter were also encouraged to participate in the numerous workshops and seminars (on translation, ludics, etc.) that she organized nonstop.  Moreover, Prof. Rapti has selflessly helped me in improving my academic work and getting it published.  Needless to say, she will be deeply missed!"]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["This is a great way to move quickly toward fluency in Greek! You will achieve an advanced level in grammar by the end of BB, learn a lot of relevant vocabulary through the thematic units (on occupations, marriage, ecology, etc.), and read some interesting cultural texts\/watch engaging movies. The quizzes and exams are definitely manageable. Calliope and Sergios are both excellent teachers, and incredibly kind people. The snacks are great, too :) You will enjoy every day of this class!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MODGRK BB","course_id":"13684","cat_num":"159843","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"MODGRK BB","course_id":"13684","cat_num":"159843","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
