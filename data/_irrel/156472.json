Justin is the best teacher I have had in college hands down. Great class.","That the class is very interesting and the workload is very manageable. It was a great class.","This class is fun and chill and you'll get a lot out of it ! Justin's a great instructor and gives you great feedback. The final paper was the best assignment as it allowed you to choose a topic you like and not just research it, but develop an experiment to find out more about something that interested you during the semester. I loved writing it and in fact, I loved all of the assignments. Really fun class!","Not that hard, great readings, very interesting, take it! Looked forward to class every week.","Take this class!! Justin is awesome, and it's really interesting material.  Do it!"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["if you have any interest in knowing underlying mechanisms and current frontiers and conceptions of how we see the world, both literally and figuratively, then it's worth it to take this class. light workload, tranquil sections","Justin does an amazing job of teaching the material. It might seem like the material is a bit dry, but he does a really good job of making the material stuff you could really engage with through discussion with your classmates. Plus, he buys delicious snacks for every class.","Professor Junge was fantastic. The course deals with some pretty difficult topics, but Justin makes them digestible and fascinating. It ended up being one of my favorite courses. Loved the small class atmosphere. Great class if you have any interest in the material. You will take away so much from the course!!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"4.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"10","response rate":"70.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 980o","course_id":"4243","cat_num":"97975","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 980o","course_id":"4243","cat_num":"97975","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"9","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 980o","course_id":"4243","cat_num":"97975","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
