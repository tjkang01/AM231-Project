The speaking practice you'll be able to do is helpful, but that is less than 1\/3 of the time of each class meeting. The rest of class time is spent reading\/translating texts that are clearly beyond your level of comprehension and that are in no way helpful."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["I would highly recommend this course, as it represents a rare opportunity to study the Uyghur language at an intermediate level. As the class size tends to be small, it allows for more individualized study that aligns with the specific interests of the students. Josh is a truly talented instructor, and brings life to the course material, even when studying challenging grammatical structures and linguistic concepts that might otherwise feel like a chore. Overall, a wonderful course.","Uyghur is a beautiful language spoken by a people whose culture, history, and present situation are all endlessly engrossing, to say the least. Josh was an outstanding teacher whose deep understanding of Uyghur language and culture showed in his presentation of the material. My ability to speak the language increased significantly over the course of the year."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"UYGHUR 120B","course_id":"919","cat_num":"4234","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"UYGHUR 120B","course_id":"919","cat_num":"4234","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"UYGHUR 120B","course_id":"919","cat_num":"4234","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
