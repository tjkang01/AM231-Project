If you are interested in seeing a wide range of film (experimental, as well as international narrative films) this course is truly for you.  Haden is a great instructor and his love for the material is infectious. I really recommend this class to anyone who wants to see a lot of unique prints and think about the medium in a new way.","If you're remotely interested in film, or have a vague understanding of what film can be and its vast spectrum, this class is for you. Coming in with a science background, but a love for the Hollywood blockbuster, I took this class to refine my crude understanding and perspectives towards film. Worthwhile, exciting, and intellectually stimulating conversations. You also watch some of the rarest prints, often ones people would die to see."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 199","course_id":"11285","cat_num":"80068","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 199","course_id":"11285","cat_num":"80068","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
