I didn't know anything at all about academia surrounding multiculturalism, and so I had very low expectations, but now realize that multiculturalism is THE contemporary issue facing Western \/ liberal democracies. The great thing about one-topic seminars is that you come out of it feeling like you really understand something from all angles. I feel like I really know this area of interest now; when I am reading literature on multiculturalism, I recognize so many cited authors and works, and it is a great feeling. You definitely need to put in the work for this class, but it's worth it. Paul is also a great facilitator and prober, so you feel challenged. And he ties in contemporary issues since it is all relevant. Each class, we read article headlines, watched documentary\/TV clips, and looked at recent polls. Recommend with enthusiasm."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
