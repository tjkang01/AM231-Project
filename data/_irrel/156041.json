It's format is essentially reading and discussing relevant papers.  It is developmental heavy, and gets in to social psych late in the semester.  Good pick to fill a department requirement.","This is a really fascinating course that I would definitely recommend to anyone interested (and with some background) in psychology. Even if you're like I was and aren't interested in the topic, the studies are really interesting and will expand your interests in the field. There were only 4 of us and we had some very engaging and in-depth conversations about the material, facilitated by the professor. This is definitely one of my favorite psych seminars I've taken, so I'd absolutely recommend giving it a chance.","This course is a really great way to discuss interesting topics with your peers and work on developing your critical thinking skills. If you put the effort in (and there really isn't much required), you're sure to get a lot out of the course!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 980T","course_id":"12586","cat_num":"156041","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 980T","course_id":"12586","cat_num":"156041","1s":"4","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
