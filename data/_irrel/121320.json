I must for first and second year graduate students in the sciences!","If you are already comfortable presenting, listening in on the first lecture is sufficient."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["You'll learn a) that you're probably not a great public speaker and b) how you might become a better one. Both are useful pieces of knowledge.","use a black background. seriously. it will save you a headache! haha. the class was good in my opinion. one person presents and then you provide feedback on what they said and more importantly how they said it.  the focus is on the mechanics of the presentation more than the content. certainly helpful for anyone who has problems speaking in front of an audience."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["You should be interested in science and intend to present research in the future.  This is a helpful way to learn how to speak about science while learning about noble prizes.","This is a great platform for developing seminar speaking\/talking skills.","Don't use this as an easy A, really try to get something out of it. Jeff's presentation style is highly polished and should be copied. Michael and Jeff give incredibly useful feedback. Take advantage of this course.","I wish the professors teaching the core courses in the first year of graduate school were forced to take this class, or even just follow the list of guidelines in Jeff's first Powerpoint lecture."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Although I like the instructors and definitely the topic of the course, I would not recommend this course to future students. If they would ask me about it, I would say that they should spend their time more efficiently.","It's a great class with not too much work.  You just have to give one ~15 minute talk on a Nobel laureate's work and show up once a week to listen to your fellow students' presentations. You will get a lot out of it though.","Great for anyone in science, regardless of how comfortable you are at presenting.","This class is good if you want to learn how to give better scientific presentations.","Attendance is important, to get the most out of the course","It's straightforward, easy, and very little work, but they give you free food and I think most people in the class genuinely learn something about both presentations and science in the process."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["I don't think this is a class that will really give you a chance to improve your presentation skills per se.  You'll hear a lot of diverse opinions about what people like in presentations, but the opinions are often too disparate to be helpful. Also, you only get one chance to present.","It's a great class to take if you wish to improve your speaking style when giving scientific presentations. The pizza given every week is a welcome bonus!","Useful! all scientists need to get better at giving talks. Jeff and Mike both are really good speakers, so they are well suited to teach this class.","Honestly very glad I took this class. It's changed the way I prepare and deliver talks."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"1.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"17","response rate":"82.35","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MCB 208","course_id":"3569","cat_num":"3605","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MCB 208","course_id":"3569","cat_num":"3605","1s":"5","2s":"8","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MCB 208","course_id":"3569","cat_num":"3605","1s":"9","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
