Be sure to read your classmates' work carefully and constructively."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["This course is wonderful, well organized, and the professors, an anthropologist and a psychoanalyst, are extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I highly recommend this course for anyone interested in ethnographic research and qualitative data analysis.","Be prepared for a LOT of [good] readings.\r\nThe interview assignments are extremely time-consuming but they're definitely worth it."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["It will teach you very fundamental and important skills for any ethnographic research and help you deal with people in an effective way during research.","It's a great course. You should take it before you go to the field.","I think this course would be most useful to those who are very clear about the kind of research projects they want to take on. For those who are less certain (and want to take an ethnography course in order to be exposed to something new), they may find the class less helpful, because the course was tailored to the kinds of methods students wanted to learn (a strength and limitation of the class).","This is a fairly unstructured class which can be a good thing and a bad thing. You genuinely learn about ethnographic methods and have several opportunities to use them, which is ideal for this class. However, the lack of a syllabus and the lack of a well defined schedule or published assignments made this class somewhat \"flimsy.\" I found myself floundering to do assignments at the very last minute because I forgot about them. This is by no means a bad class, it's actually pretty enjoyable and helps add some fun to your semester. It's merely in need of some structuring.","This is a relaxed course introducing qualitative research methods-- highly suited for non-anthropology students.","To have some research ideas in mind and use this course as a test field for those research ideas.","Your work will have meaning if you're willing to throw yourself into it.","In its format this year, I would not recommend the course, but this is largely because it was the first year it was offered and still had kinks to get worked out, and it needed more organization. If there is more organization in the future, I think it can be a valuable methods training."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.20","workload":"2.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.30","enrollment":"11","response rate":"54.55","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 2628","course_id":"206","cat_num":"108949","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 2628","course_id":"206","cat_num":"32957","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 2628","course_id":"206","cat_num":"108949","1s":"2","2s":"9","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
