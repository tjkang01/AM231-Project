Assignments throughout the year, from an initial topic summary to a data report to the final draft, are spaced to help you stay on track and receive ample feedback from peers and advisors. Kiran's section is fantastic.","Kiran is absolutely amazing -- she cares so much about you and your interests\/research\/thesis and is completely dedicated to helping you out whenever you need it. She helps lay out clear steps and offers you honest and detailed critique. My thesis would not have happened without her, and that is not an overstatement of any kind!","The economics department does an absolutely wonderful job of supporting students through the senior thesis process. The seminar leaders are so dedicated and I really built up a community of students who were in the same seminar. Kiran, in particular, is AMAZING!","Kiran is amazing. Get her as your seminar leader no matter what, and you will have the best thesis experience in the economics department.","Writing a thesis is probably the most difficult and rewarding thing I've done while at Harvard. I highly recommend it - the sense of accomplishment, subject area expertise, and ability to work closely with a member of the faculty is well worth the stress. Would do it again! You can always start and then drop halfway if you're not making progress (although I do not think you will - if you want to finish, you will finish). Good luck! :)"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"15.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 985LB","course_id":"13494","cat_num":"159910","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 985LB","course_id":"13494","cat_num":"159910","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"3"}},"success":true}
