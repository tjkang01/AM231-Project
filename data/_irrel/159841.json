My Greek family is actually impressed with how much I learned! Good for anyone interested in Classics, fulfilling the language requirement painlessly, or who just wants to go to Greece!","I am not Greek but definitely fell in love with this class. I think if you're looking for something fun and different, or if you have been to\/are going to go to Greece, you should take it!","Fantastic course if you want to learn the Greek language. Really great teaching fellows and instructors."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["This class is a blast! You will learn so much about Greece and not even realize that you are doing any work along the way because the class is taught so seamlessly. If you are at all interested in Greece or Greek culture take this class!!!!","This class is a true gem of Harvard's curriculum. The instructors are wonderful people and truly care about helping every student to fully understand the material, and they also progress through the topics carefully, making sure that everybody understands before moving on. Also, you get to learn about Greek culture (including food!) in addition to the language. All in all, I would highly recommend this course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MODGRK AB","course_id":"13480","cat_num":"159841","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"MODGRK AB","course_id":"13480","cat_num":"159841","1s":"2","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
