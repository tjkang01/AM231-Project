He is so kind, helpful, and wants his students to learn Swahahili! He is wonderful. I recommend!!!","A relatively fun and easy way to complete the language requirement. It is interesting to learn more about african culture as well.","This is a very good course to get through the language requirement. Only meets three times per week. You get as much or as little as you put into it. Thats what I read when I read the Q guide last year, and I think this is the most accurate. Professor Mugane teaches in a different style, but if you follow along in class and keep up with vocabulary, you will be able to read and write in swahili.","Professor Mugane's Swahili class is a really fun experience. It's quite laid back and low stress, but you do end up having learned quite a lot. It's not as intensive as some other language classes (for instance, you won't have to worry about spending two hours each night studying a vocabulary list). It's a great way to satisfy the language requirement, as well as to simply get an introduction to this really fun Bantu language and the culture of East Africa.","This course is a blast - it's very laid-back in terms of rigor, and Mugane is a hoot. However, it's poorly organized, and constantly feels like it could be better and more effective if the teaching staff did more planning.","You have to be sure that you want to learn swahili."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Be prepared for a lack of structure, a nagging feeling that you're failing the course, and exams that test you on more than you could possibly know.","Definitely take this class. Swahili is by far one of the most fun classes I have taken this semester, and I have learned so much. Judith and John are so amazing at teaching and they do a really good job of ensuring all students learn the material and have a fun time doing so.","Professor Mugane, our first semester professor, did a terrible job preparing us for second semester, and Judi did her best to catch us up but moved at an unrealistic pace and left some students in the dust. She operates on the pace set by the most advanced students (in our case, students who had lived in East Africa for extended periods of time or had Arabic\/Bantu language backgrounds), becoming frustrated and sometimes rude to other students for moving at a slower pace. This aside, this semester was an enormous improvement and Judi proved to be far more competent and dedicated than her husband, Mugane, who will go down as my least effective professor at Harvard in all my time here. I learned a lot this semester, and polished what he failed to teach me previously. Judi is usually wonderful, and it's a fun class and a nice community. Wish grading had been more transparent\/fair \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I have no idea what is coming as far as grades go, despite doing consistently well in the class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"3.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"11","response rate":"72.73","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SWAHILI AB","course_id":"13683","cat_num":"159829","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"5","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"SWAHILI AB","course_id":"13683","cat_num":"159829","1s":"2","2s":"7","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
