to take Finnish, so take this class.

She really tries to focus her teaching to your needs.","Finnish is so great! With such a small class we all get much more attention. We also do fun stuff like play with Barney stuffed animals... :)"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["You'll get as much or as little out of this class as you put in; it's in your best interests to clear time so that you can get lots out of it.","Finnish is an extremely fun course. The language is beautiful and the approach is"]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This tutorial, which features a small group and mostly flexible arrangements, has been a wonderful opportunity to gain exposure to Finnish in a manageable way.  Saana McDaniel, who instructed the tutorial this semester, is incredibly understanding of the different levels that students can be at for learning a new language. She brings an enormous amount of enthusiasm and energy that has made learning Finnish immensely engaging rather than intimidating.","If you have an interest in learning Finnish, take this class! It is well structured to ensure that students are learning this difficult language in the best way possible. However, the difficult grammar would make it less than enjoyable for someone who is not interested or dedicated."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This is a great way to learn the basics of the Finnish language. There is not a lot of work involved with the course. However, the language is very difficult, so you get as much out of this class as you're willing to put in.","Saana is an incredibly kind teacher who is willing to work with students at all levels. Although Finnish is a challenging language to learn, Saana and the tutorial style make it amazingly accessible and very enriching as a learning experience. I would recommend the tutorial to anyone who seeks learning Finnish for their curricular needs."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["First, Finnish is an awesome language -- don't be scared by the case system. \nSecond, Saana is a wonderful teacher. She will teach at a pace that works for the people in the class, is very enthusiastic and energetic, and understands that life happens. If you're at all interested in learning Finnish, take this course. You will learn a lot."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Take this course if you have any interest whatsoever in learning Finnish. It is an amazing opportunity that you really only get at Harvard. You get one-on-one time with the most amazing instructor and you get to learn the language in such a unique setting. I've gotten so much out of this course and I would definitely recommend taking it."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["These language tutorial courses are such a great opportunity and I would strongly recommend taking one of them! This is totally an under-utilized resource at Harvard and I think more students should take these courses. Saana is an especially wonderful Finnish teacher and it's a low-stress class that teaches you so much."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Take this course!
