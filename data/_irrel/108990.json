I doubt anyone can repeat Professor Enderlein's bravura performance.","Prof. Enderlein is the best! This has been one of the most enjoyable courses I have taken at Harvard. The course's approach to the Euro-crisis, although econ heavy, provides insightful and thought provoking perspectives to public policy in general.","Amazing course - Most rewarding and enjoyable class I have taken this year.
