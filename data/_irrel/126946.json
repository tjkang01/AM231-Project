The homework is going to be terribly tedious. There was a point where in which I realized that no one has a clear understanding of what is actually the homework asking for.","Make sure you have excellent programming skills and you know gene biology prior to enrolling.","You will improve skills in Python and R, but generally the computational biology concepts can be quite confusing and you will have to look things up on google.","If you are to take this course, make sure to have at least a few introductory biology courses under your belt or else the lecture pace will be too fast.","Although the class gives a broad overview of the field of computational biology, it fails to sufficiently introduce the biological terminology used throughout the course. Without a prior knowledge of both biology and programming, you will be lost at some point during the semester."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Don't take this course.  Although Shirley was engaged and Daniel was sympathetic, it is poorly designed and demands too much.  Almost any other class will be more efficacious.","You should have the right background before taking this class."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Do not take this course, unless you are required to do so. It is not a well taught or thought out course in terms of the assignments and lectures. Prep yourself for something that will be a bit of a drag.","it seems to have improved since previous years, but it's too broad of a course to be useful for those interested in computational biology","Course will give you broad exposure to various algorithms in computational biology, but will not give you refined skills or much in depth practice programming. Good for biologist who want basic exposure to computational techniques."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["Only take this class if you already know how to program, especially doing shell scripts and unix command line. It is a good survey of the latest methods in bioinformatics (gene expression, GWAS, cancer biology, regulatory networks, motif finding, etc). However, so many topics are covered you will not go in depth with any of them, and it will be overwhelming trying to keep up with the dizzying variety of topics. It is NOT a statistical class at all. It's more of a molecular biology class with a lot of programming.","Great overview of bioinformatic methods","This is a useful class to take if you are considering working in the bioinformatics or computational biology field. If you don't have any programming experience it would take you a long time to finish homeworks.","If you are interested in computational biology, have a solid background in biology and programming, but aren't sure if it is for you...than this is a good class to explore the field with."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["An excellent course. If you are interested in bioinformatics, this is a must-take course and Shirley is a very engaging teacher and a recognized expert in the field.  Even if you are unsure if bioinformatics is your thing, but you are interested in high dimensional\/big data, then you will learn a lot of useful things in the course. \r\nThis course takes a lot of your time.  If you are taking four courses, plan on spending the majority of your time on this one.  The homeworks are challenging, especially if you have limited programming experience.  Ideally, a student taking this course would have a background in statistics, computer science, and biology, but none of them are absolutely necessary to take the course.  R\/Python skills will be helpful, or at least a willingness to learn based on some other programming language experience.  The lectures will make more sense if you understand some molecular biology, but one again, not necessary to complete the assignment.\r\nHighly recommend this course for anyone interested in this area."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["This class was extremely useful for my research in computational biology. Shirley covers most important topics in the field, so it filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge. It also provided me with insight into different ways to tackle biological questions. The homework assignments, while long and difficult, did improve my skills as a computational biology researcher. I think anyone interested in pursuing computational biology should take this class, though be prepared to put a lot of time into it because the homework assignments take a long time!","Take this class if you want to get started with bioinformatics but be prepared to be independent and the workload.","I think this is a great course if you've already had some exposure to computational biology, either from previous coursework or from research. It really gives a good overview of areas where the field is advancing, and presents all the common techniques\/algorithms used today, along with intuition behind how they work. Shirley Liu's lectures are really good. She's good at explaining complex concepts simply and providing intuition.\r\n\r\nAs for the workload, it's not too bad if you have experience in the area before, but could be bad if you haven't. You'll need to learn how to use R and Python and various R packages and command line tools on a Unix computing cluster (Odyssey). It's a lot for someone with no experience, so be aware if that's you. Otherwise, if you've had experience before, the assignments aren't too challenging. The one to watch out for is assignment 3, which is way longer than the others. You do have 6 late days, though, which is nice.\r\n\r\nOverall I think this is a very doable class if you've had exposure to computational biology before. Otherwise, be prepared to spend a lot of time.","This course was one of the most rewarding classes I have ever taken. It is definitely challenging, but if you put in the time to really understand the material, you will come out with   a solid foundation, which you can use to analyze bioinformatic data.","One of the top three courses I've taken at Harvard.","Great dive into the world of bioinformatics"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"16.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"11","response rate":"72.73","QCourseOverall":{"number":"BIOSTAT 298","course_id":"423","cat_num":"126946","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"BIOSTAT 298","course_id":"423","cat_num":"15673","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"BIOSTAT 298","course_id":"423","cat_num":"126946","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"4"}},"success":true}
