Not only do you have the opportunity to work closely with HFA director Dr. Haden Guest, but you also get the chance to watch gems of the noir cycle in 35 mm. Even with his busy schedule, Dr. Guest is extremely approachable and always helpful during office hours or chats after screenings. The material of the course is also superb. The readings include Borde and Chaumeton's Panorama of Film Noir as well as selections from Edward Dimendberg's Film Noir and the Spaces of Modernity. The screenings are 35 mm prints of rarely seen films as well as traditional classics. What makes this class special, however, is the amount that you learn from the discussions with your colleagues.","If you'd like to go beyond the pop cultural clich\u00c3\u00a9s of Film Noir and study the cycle as a historical AND formal AND thematic phenomenon, definitely take this class. (Also: you'll be watching incredible, historically significant films on 35mm. Consider yourself lucky.)","Be prepared to put time and serious thought into this class if you plan to get much out of it. That being said, the films are a wonderful experience and there are endlessly interesting discussions to be had about them. You will emerge understanding a great deal about film noir. If film analysis is something you enjoy, take this course!","Haden Guest is an extremely knowledgable film historian and this course is a great film studies experience. The films range from classics to lesser-known gems. Lots of time spent watching the films, but it's worth it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"8.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"10","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 198","course_id":"12198","cat_num":"126500","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 198","course_id":"12198","cat_num":"126500","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
