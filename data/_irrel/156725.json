Room for debate. Good chance to interact with high-level speakers.","The course provided valuable knowledge about European democracies, tools to understand modern political and campaign tactics, and had a very stimulating speaker series.","Esta clase se da en espa\u00c3\u00b1ol - es muy buena onda el profesor, y las discusiones son muy inclusivas. El profesor es muy inteligente y habla por la mayoria de cada sesion, dandoles a todos una oportunidad al final a discutir lo ue se ha remitido.","This class is a true gem. The strengths are that it promotes an awareness of the world at large in an extremely interactive and intimate class-setting. The professor goes over topics that are important for anyone interested in government or politics--touching upon several parallels between Spain, Europe and the USA, without requiring any prior knowledge on the material, just interest. \r\n\r\nAlso, the teaching is fantastic. Professor Martinez is an engaging lecturer. His slides are well-organized, clear and insightful. He also invites several speakers who are protagonists in their fields. Plus (NOTE, THIS IS IMPORTANT:) having a class fully led in spanish has been a unique and rewarding experience for me. It distinguishes this seminar from others in the Government department. If you are fluent in spanish (both spoken and written), I would highly suggest entering the lottery for it and taking it! You WON'T regret it!","It is a bit intimidating to be in a class with a bunch of Spanish students, even if you area  native speaker, just because of the way and pace that they speak. But its not that big of a deal in the end."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"2.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 94ES","course_id":"12835","cat_num":"156725","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 94ES","course_id":"12835","cat_num":"156725","1s":"3","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
