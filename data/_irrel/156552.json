Class activities were enjoyable, including debates (she organized a great one about the Trail of Tears!), object presentations, and more conventional discussions of assigned readings. As an instructor, she facilitated discussion well and was particularly good at maintaining consistent contact with students (sending weekly emails with questions to think about, general plans for class, and other fun tid bits, like links to extra material, relevant youtube videos). The course was relatively demanding, with a heavy reading load, and it might have been helpful to have workshopped our final papers a bit more, if nothing else to learn more about other students' paper topics, but the class focused on the syllabus closely, which made sense given the ambitious nature of the course. The course was clearly designed with an attentiveness to incorporating a range of experiences of the West (i.e. not just the dominant narratives of Anglo-American pioneers), which was refreshing and illuminating. And Rhae Lynn's dedication and enthusiasm for the subject matter and for teaching in general made the course fun and meaningful. I wish more instructors at Harvard took such an effort to get to know students (having us come in several times to her office hours to chat about our interests, not just in relation to projects for class, but more broadly), and more classes at Harvard should take this kind of approach of experimenting with digital media (we looked at many examples of digitized databases of artifacts and other multimedia ways of presenting research).","This class can be at times very insightful and inspiring, and at times a pain. There is a lot of assignments each week that sometimes aren't even addressed in class, and sometimes the class seemed like a lot of work for not much payoff. That being said, there were some genuine moments of inspiration in class, and Professor Barnes is clearly very invested in the course, which is great. She encourages you to challenge traditional understandings of our history, and there were thus many great ideas and revelations that I took away from the course. Bottom line: can be great, but be prepared to put in some hours.","Barnes is a fantastic seminar leader...only qualm is the AMOUNT of reading and a bit too much emphasis on the early West, which can get a bit dry and remote.","This is the best class I have taken so far at Harvard. It goes far beyond the \"westward progression of civilization\" version of western history that we hear so often and delves into what is truly a colorful, nuanced story of the people who lived and moved west of the Mississippi. The reading list is excellent (one of the books we read made it into my top 10 favorite books of all time) and RhaeLynn does a great job of facilitating discussions that go beyond just talking to earn participation points. RhaeLynn is inspiring, energized, incredibly knowledgable and very communicative and helpful when it comes to the research paper.","A terrific seminar. Great readings (though certainly not a light reading load) and a fascinating topic. The class was a fun and exciting way to re-examine American history and to trace contemporary happenings to the events of the past. Barnes' investment in each individual student is tremendous, and you really feel like she cares about the work you are doing both in and out of the class. Standard seminar workload, but the subject material is so varied that there is something for everyone to get excited about.","This is an excellent seminar. Barnes leads the sections wonderfully and the material is great! Definitely take this course if you can!","This is an exciting and wide-ranging examination of what exactly the US West is, the myth and the reality. Be prepared to do good research and to think creatively about history. The readings are consistently fascinating and the class discussions lively.","This is a course with great readings, a great instructor, and is really worth taking. The material is tremendously important, and you likely won't read much of it in other courses.","This class requires a lot of work! You are reading about a book a week and also researching and writing a twenty-page paper that is based on primary sources (which are not the easiest to get your hands on, especially since one of them has to be from an archive). The material is very interesting, but be prepared to make this your \"hard\" class for the semester.","This class is a lot of work but interesting.","I'm a graduating senior, and this was one of the best courses I have ever taken. I've never taken a course on American history at Harvard, so I was a bit nervous at the beginning -- but the professor is so capable at facilitating class discussions and assigning great material that I never felt as if I was at a disadvantage. All of the readings were fascinating, as were the class discussions. There are a lot of myths surrounding American history -- many of which are taught in high schools, including mine -- so the ability to engage critically with the topics in this course is incredibly important. I'm a more informed and critical citizen because of this course!","Rhae Lynn is wonderful, definitely take a class with her if you have an opportunity to do so! This class is a larger time commitment than other junior seminars, but you will get so much more out of it, especially in terms of thinking critically about things outside the course and improving your writing.","Fight tooth and nail to get into this course.   I am confident that Rhae Lynn is going to incorporate feedback that we gave her and make the course even better, so DEFINITELY take it because it will be even better than it was this year!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"6.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"16","response rate":"93.75","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
