{"scores":[],"comments":{"Fall '15":{"comments":["Emily and Amanda area very enthusiastic about making sure we get the best experience out of this class! They are very receptive to feedback and make the material very interesting! The topic itself is not one where I am constantly wow-ed by the sense of touch, but it is really cool to learn about this subject in great detail! We are really becoming experts, which is a good feeling!","This was probably the sensory pathway that I was least familiar with but after taking one semester of this class, I have grown fascinated with it.  In this class, you can get a lot out of it if you invest yourself. Try to truly comprehend the readings before coming to class and try to go through the supplementary readings whenever possible.","Touch is an awesome subject to study, and it is awesome to work with Emily and Amanda because they have so much enthusiasm for the subject matter.","This is a great option for a tutorial! Amanda and Emily are great, and they are really accessible outside of class if you have any questions. The workload is manageable, and the topic is really cool--who knew touch could be so interesting!","Emily and Amanda are incredibly kind and great teachers.  They give back helpful feedback and are willing to answer all questions to the best of their abilities.","An amazing course! The material is interesting and Amanda and Emily are simply amazing. I've loved every minute of it."]}},"mostRecentQ":null,"success":true}
