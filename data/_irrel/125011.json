'08":{"comments":["There is nothign better than a challenge; Spanish C is it!","spanish A is simply not enough preparation for the class.","easy but boring","class in between Spanish A and Spanish 30...","The professor was always extremely enthusiastic and willing to answer questions, from explaining complex ideas in the readings we had done to offering general corrections of our grammar and vocabulary usage when we were speaking. After coming out of the class, I feel much more confident interacting in Spanish, and look forward to honing my skills in future language classes.","If you need to meet your foreign language requirement and have taken Spanish in high school, you should take this course.  It's easy going enough that it won't effect your performance in the courses you're interested in, but at the same time it requires just enough of your attention that you do continue to learn the language.","Only take it if you have to.  It was fine, but not very intellectually stimulating.","Good, easy refresher class on spanish","this class is a good review of spanish grammar and introduces new literature","Be prepared to work pretty hard, especially for a language class, but there are definitely a lot of benefits to be had.","I would like to tell future students that this class is very helpful for increasing fluency in Spanish. Additionally, it is useful for reviewing prior knowledge of Spanish and strengthening your basic skills. The amount of reading, writing, listening, and speaking in Spanish enables you to become more comfortable and familiar with the language.","It's a fun, easy-going course that definitely makes you much better at Spanish.","well taught\r\nI liked that section was taught all in Spanish. I learned a lot -- it was a good deal of material but it was taught thoroughly.","It's fun, well-taught, and not that bad of a workload.","You will learn about Spanish and Latin American culture while bettering your Spanish speaking skills.","Do not think that just because you placed into Spanish 30 or 40, like I did, that you should immediately immerse yourself in a Harvard class.  Dropping down a level or two will help you to begin to develop the oral and  listening skills you will need in higher Spanish classes.  And, besides, the grammar is a simple review for you students, too.","This is a fun and interesting class that is guaranteed to make you a better spanish speaker. The sections are very enjoyable, the material is interesting, and the TF's are wonderful. Though the class can be a bot overwhelming at first, it becomes something that you truly look forward to.","This class is excellent for integrating all of the material learned in high school spanish.","This class is very interesting, and informs you not only about the Spanish language, but also about Hispanic Culture. However, be prepared for a lot of busywork.","This class is lively and very helpful.","Take it only if you will thoroughly enjoy Spanish","This class is really helpful and it's not always necessary to do the work. The section component is very good.","This class is challenging and more focused on reading comprehension than learning to speak the language.","Fun, enjoyable, not too much work, and you can learn a lot.","I recommend this course with no recommendation, especially if you're considering Sra. Schulze as your section leader.","The course work is manageable and Professor Fernandez is great.","Take your placement results seriously.","Learn the material, then complete workbook assignments. This will help with what you are actually studying and trying to understand.","This is definitely intended as a review class (I mean, the textbook is called \"Repaso.\" Really.) and so it worked especially well for the freshmen in my class who hadn't had Spanish in a year or so and didn't remember much. \r\nIt also worked out well for me, because I could take time to improve vocab while they stumbled over grammar.","This is a very good class, but be prepared to attend all classes in order to gain maximum comprehension of the material and grammar.","Try and get Martha Diaz as your section leader.","Spanish C is the perfect blend of Spanish grammar and cultural studies.  I was able to hone my conversational skills while studying thought-provoking and interesting materials.","This course is what you make it, and you will get back the amount of time and energy you had been willing to put forth.","It's a necessary building block. Take it if you need to\/want to.","Have command of the language.","If you put in some time and are moderately proficient in Spanish you will get an A.","I loved this class. I think it was a really good way for me to improve my Spanish in a very friendly, forgiving setting.","Small class sizes allow for great language practice.\r\nEnvironment is welcoming and conducive to speaking improvement.","It's an awesome and fun class, while still being very helpful","Must have an in depth knowledge of vocabulary prior to the course.","If you really want to learn Spanish, and you happen to be at the appropriate level for this course, by all means take it. However, I did find it rather tedious having class four times a week, and I found many of the assignments to be busywork. Needless to say, it got a little boring at times.","It's fun, easy, and you learn a lot of Spanish.","If you want a class that meets often and reviews most of the grammar you learned in high school, this is a good class for you.","The course is good for maintenance of language skills, not so much for acquisition of such; not very well structured.","Very good.  Always have homework, so it is time consuming.","it is a good class but very difficult to get a good grade or improve your grade if you dont start out with a very solid foundation in spanish a","It is an excellent, vigorous introduction to Spanish and engages you to learn Spanish almost to fluency if you put forth the effort.","Don't be shy and participate! The more practice you get speaking Spanish, the more likely you are to improve.","Don't be wary of intermediate Spanish. The grammar review is very simple. The exams are not bad at all. The readings can be somewhat challenging, but there is plenty of time spent going over them in class and amply opportunities to figure out the keys to the story.","You will learn a lot while having fun!","Its very manageable","Solid review of grammar, interesting and relatively challenging readings, reasonable workload.","The course is great and Professor Gutierrez is a fantastic professor.","Students should expect to dedicate time outside of class in order to practice and to improve their speaking and comprehension abilities. Spanish C is a worthwhile course, and students who take it seriously will likely benefit from it.","Spanish C is a fun class that exposes students to the Spanish language and culture.","I would tell future students that this class played an important role in improving my Spanish language skills at the intermediate level.  It introduced me to many new ideas about the Spanish culture and was particularly effective in enabling me to improve my Spanish reading abilities.  I would tell future students that I enjoyed the discussions triggered by the readings of this class and that I would recommend it because it helped me to develop my Spanish skills and engage more effectively with the Spanish language and culture.","This class is a preparation for in-depth spanish classes to follow. Here we review all the Spanish grammar, go over important cultural events and issues, and get comfortable speaking Spanish without having to think about it so much (it no longer becomes a \"chore\"). Most students taking this course are interested in getting a Language Citation, and many are eager to become fluent in Spanish.","It's a very clear, solid course on Spanish grammar. It will give you a good background to keep learning Spanish, but it is like any Spanish course. When there's so many amazing courses at Harvard it's hard to justify taking a Spanish course that could be taken almost anywhere.","It's the next level spanish course, it has a relatively low workload, but it's not particularly interesting or rigorous.","If you have already taken some Spanish and want a Spanish lit or conversation course, you may want to look at different courses in the Romance Languages dept. If you took a little Spanish in high school and are looking to freshen up your grammar and speaking skills, then this is a good class to take.","If you want to take Spanish, of course, you have to take this class. It's a good recap for people who weren't taught Spanish properly in high school.","The class not only broadened my understanding and knowledge of the Spanish language, but also of the cultures in various Spanish-speaking countries.","This is a great course to comfortably improve one's spanish speaking skill. The work load is very managable and the learning environment is very accomodating to people of a wide array of spanish level.","The course is an effective review course.","This class was not particularly challenging academically.","You have to take this course, but watch out on the workload. Initially, you will do very little, and this will create the habit of low dedication towards the class, which can hurt you later in the semester. Also, you may often feel like you have many unanswered questions about material through the course. Definitely try to find, early on, resources like the Spanish tutoring service that can help you.","It is a great way to have a small class and improve your Spanish."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["The small classes really make learning the language fun and easy.

I think I could have done with a lot more oral practice.","I really enjoyed Spanish C! Take the course if you have the opportunity!","This is a wonderful class that helps you to improve you listening, speaking, writing, and readings skills.  And  also broadens your vocabulary.","Take Spanish C if you enjoy learning Spanish. If not, you won't enjoy it.","The class meets 4 days a week and is often tedious. It is fairly easy and most people do well.","I would recommend this class to people who know basic Spanish and want to review it.  I did not learn anything new (besides vocabulary); this class was all grammar review.  I wish the course description had been clearer about that so I'd known what to expect.  The class was good overall and my grammar improved, although I wish we had practiced speaking more.","Spanish C is a well-designed course that taught me a lot of Spanish and made me more confident in my language skills.  It's best if you put effort into it.","try to take it with Alicia, she was great!","take this course if you want to improve your communication and reading skills not so much writing","Not too bad.  Fun sometimes.  TFs are nice.","I really enjoyed taking this class.  It was a low stress way to discuss Spanish writing and culture and to work on speaking\/listening\/writing skills.","Components of the course seem fuzzy and unclear sometimes, but if you make the concerted individual effort to stay on top of the work and constantly make sure you understand what is going on, you will be fine.","This class is a watered-down version of Spanish 30.  It has the same grammar review book but has easier assignments.  Take Spanish 30 instead if you really want to learn.","It may be hard but it really helps with language profficiency","If you have taken high school Spanish then get ready to take it all over again.","This class is an easy, straight-forward class to fill your schedule.  The overall atmosphere is relaxed, the assignments are primarily quizzes and writing compositions, and the readings are interesting.","It is a great lass if you're interested in learning to speak Spanish, but aren't quite proficient, or just don't want to work too hard for a semester.","This class was a wonderful way to improve my Spanish language skills, especially my spoken Spanish.  I very much look forward to continuing to study Spanish at Harvard.","It is a good class, but it takes some time to adjust to the way it is taught and the amount of speaking.","Be sure to get Anca as your section leader.","It's a good review\/refresher course for those who have already had basic Spanish.","Choose a good section leader.. it will impact your learning immensely.","This class provides you with a tremendous opportunity to enhance your Spanish-speaking and writing abilities, while also providing a sense of cultural enhancement.","I learned and improved my spanish a lot more in Ab, this class was helpful in keeping my spanish sharp but i didnt feel like i improved as much. I would probably tell kids that they could skip it and go to Spanish 30","Future students may want to jump to Spanish 30 if their grammar abilities are strong.","This class gives, in my opinion, the appropriate amount of work for a lower level language course. It gives you the opportunity to improve your writing skills, your reading comprehension skills, and your ability to discuss issues in Spanish.","I hope you get Anca for an instructor!","It's a great class!"]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["Great class!

In terms of workload, less than Aa an Ab (of course the spanish is more advanced).","It's a good, friendly class that doesn't require too much time, but you need to be self motivated in it to assure that you keep learning.","prepare to work.","great class for beginners with some exposure to the language (up to 1 year).","Spanish C is more than I'd expect from such a large class, though the sections could have been a little smaller.","You should take this class with Martha because you will come out with a fluent grasp on spanish.","a fun way to improve your spanish with a lot of poems, stories, visual media and a lovely teacher","The class is good if you need\/want to clean up your Spanish grammar abilities or if you need to fulfill a Spanish requirement.  It won't necessarily drastically improve your speaking and listening in Spanish, though.  If you feel comfortable speaking Spanish and you like the language, you may want to consider trying something a little more challenging.","Great class, but it's 4 days a week which could limit other courses being taken.","It's pretty fun if you have a good section. Start the compostitions ahead of time","This class was mostly review. If you shop the class and feel like the syllabus looks familiar, you might want to talk to the professor about jumping to Spanish 30.","It is a really great class, not too much work, and is just a lot of fun.  Lots of presentations, music video watching, and discussing interesting stories.","Easy and fun!","Prisca was a great instructor","This class is very comparable to AP Spanish.","This is a great class.  Don't be afraid to speak up in class - the teacher would rather you stumble through Spanish than resort to using English.","Review your vocabulary and speaking beforehand.","Really good class. By the end, my spanish was noticably better.","It is a nice class which is mainly based on little stories about various themes related to Spanish culture. If you apply yourself, you will leave with a solid understanding of Spanish grammar.","Students who enjoy foreign language will find this course both a very good review of basic Spanish grammar and a meaningful introduction into the body of Spanish literature.","Make sure that you are willing and ready to make it to class everyday!","It is a great class, though it does require a significant amount of work each week.","This class is great for reviewing grammar as well as forcing you to think in spanish, analyze stories and poems, and become more confident in your speaking.","Get on the good side of your tf","This is a fun class that will challenge your spanish skills and make you a better speaker. However, it is very important to join\/ pick a TF that speaks so that you can understand him\/her. (no or limited accent and decent pace)","Spanish C is a great way to polish off your Spanish and familiarize yourself with issues of the Spanish-speaking world.  The class is fast-paced, but it is worth it.","It's important to get the right teacher--it makes ALL the difference. I shopped another class with a teacher different than Prof. Dorado, and it was PAINFUL. The teacher was quiet, passive and threatened, and the class was bored and unmotivated. Prof. Dorado's class, by contrast, was a paradise of energy and engagement.","You will probably learn a lot but it isn't as fun as Spanish A. If you are coming from Spanish A, be cautious because you may not be ready for this, unless you don't mind being behind.","This course was an excellent refresher in Spanish and I'm very satisfied with the amount of review and practice that was accomplished; I look forward to future Spanish courses!","A good understanding of Spanish is definitely necessary.","The class is a moderately easy way to improve your Spanish.","Make sure to pay attention in class and your understanding of Spanish will improve."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["Great way to dive back into Spanish after a little time off, interesting","It's the most fun I've had with a language class","take this class it is sweet and easy if you know spanish","Very chill, small sections, extremely easy.","Put enough effort into the class. If you do you can get an A. If not you'll struggle for a B simply because you didn't put enough time in.","The class is extremely engaging and interesting.  Also your speaking and comprehension of another language improves drastically.","be active in class!","Try to get a good TF.  If you dont, it could be detrimental towards your understanding of spanish","If you're trying to learn Spanish, you can't really get out of taking it, but that's fine because it's a really fun class.  The format is pretty similar to what I found in Spanish Ab and my teacher (Maria del Carmen Dorado) was really amazing.  Don't expect to be fluent by the end, because you don't really learn much more than you learned in A, but it's good practice.","This class improves speaking skills through daily class discussion as well as writing skills through compositions.","If you have to take this class to meet the language requirement, it isn't bad. It's not too much work. Just know though that it is quite a big jump from Spanish Ab. You will be expected to speak at a bit higher level. Otherwise, the course is fun, the teachers in the Spanish department are all amazing and fun people.","I took this class to get back into spanish and it was great for that","It basically covers the same grammatical points as Ab. It's good for developing reading comprehension and continuing practice in Spanish, but there is little in terms of oral instruction.","Although this class can be intimidating at first, if you stick with it, you will become a lot more comfortable with your listening, reading, and writing in spanish. The class is fun because you get to go beyond the basics of grammar and talk about interesting topics.","Much easier than Spanish Ab, with the same material.","A lot of homework, but learned a ton.","This class really does not involve that much work and I thought it improved my Spanish abilities a lot. We only had to read a story or poem a couple of nights a week or do some exercises in Repaso, but those never that long. Also, the compositions were helpful and the TFs were helpful. The exams also weren't difficult. But I actually learned a lot in the course because I was able to participate in class with only six other students there. If this is your level of Spanish, I would definitely take it. It's almost like a review of Spanish Ab, but great because we reviewed a lot of verb tenses.","Spanish C is awesome!","This is a low-stress, fun way to maintain speaking Spanish","This class is a good introduction to spanish literature","This is a great course \"refresher.\"","Great class if you want to start improving your Spanish.","stay on top of readings and stuff","Be ready to read a lot more material in Spanish!","Spanish is a great language to learn and Eustolia is a great professor to learn it from! She makes sure you appreciate and enjoy the language and the accompanying cultures.","The class was good for me to review my knowledge of Spanish, but I felt that it was a little vague-- I learned little new material, and in a fairly haphazard way.","The class is a good review of Spanish and is very fun, especially if you get a good TF. It helps you brush up on your Spanish skills, but if you really want to improve significantly at speaking, I'd suggest going abroad. There's only so much you can learn in the classroom.","learn vocabulary on your own and start your compositions early.","This class is easy to follow and do well in as long as you put in the weekly work  -  there is alot of busy work, and it helps if you have a good TF.","It may seem like a pain to get up for spanish almost every day, but the class can really be fun, and you learn something that can be really useful and life.","This class is generally a relaxing approach to the language.  You'll grow in your ability to comprehend the language orally.  Some of the readings were almost too impenetrable, requiring constant reference to dictionaries.","It's a good class and helpful intro if you are interested in learning Spanish and moving on to upper level classes.","The daily homework can be annoying, but you will definitely see a big improvement in your speaking, reading, and writing skills by the end of the semester.","Covers very similar areas to Spanish Ab -- a lot of lit and not so much language.","one of my favorite classes~","This class is more than the typical sit-down and learn quietly. It's an active, fun environment."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["Fast paced but enjoyable!","it is a very institutionalized class--theres nothing personal about it.","Make sure you put in the necessary time to make an educated decision of which Spanish course is your level before enrolling in this course.","Doesn't significantly improve your understanding of the language. The best option is to study abroad","If you get a teacher that cares about the class, you have hit the jackpot. The teachers walk you through the course in the kindest way possible, and never once make you feel intimidated or underprepared for any concept.","This class is good for brushing up on Spanish or picking it up again if you've taken a break from it.","The course is extremely good, and you should take it if you really want to learn spanish and are at the level for Spanish C. It really enforces and improves your speaking, reading, and writing skills. Furthermore, professor Ana Lopez is extremely good and engaging as an instructor, so if you have her, I would recommend the course all the more.","Be prepared for nightly, high-school'esque homework. Keep in mind that class is meant to be fun - don't stress over the work (which is a pretty light load anyway) and you're sure to have a great experience.","Spanish C is a solid class that will reinforce your Spanish skills. As much time is devoted to discussing cultural and historical issues in the Spanish-speaking world as grammar. Thoroughly doing all the readings is not essential to getting a good grade, but you will miss out on a large part of the class if you don't come prepared to class discussions. If you've already done AP Spanish or had four years of high school Spanish, you will likely find this class easy and at times boring (especially the grammar review), but it's nevertheless a good refresher if you're not confident enough to take 30.\r\nDon't come in this class thinking you will improve your speaking skills a ton (for that you really do need extensive one-on-one practice outside of class), but they will improve.","If you have already taken Spanish Aa and Ab or 4 years of high school Spanish, this class is a waste of time...take Spanish 30.","This class will definitely expand your cultural connections with Latin American countries, improve your speaking and writing abilities, and inspire you to become as fluent as possible in the language.","grading is a bit harsh (95+ is an A) but overall, a good class","It was hard, and it really stretched my understanding of the language.  Make sure you shop TFs because they make a huge difference in this course.","try to get the coursehead as a tf","Take it if you love Spanish and want to continue to learn about the culture and history.","I love learning Spanish, but this class wasn't as practical (for learning and practicing oral and written grammar) as I would have liked it to be. It was more literature based than I thought was necessary.","If you are a freshman who took a substantial amount of Spanish in high school but still aren't fluent and want to brush up on some things, it may make sense to take this class.  If you're a sophomore or above and you've taken Spanish Aa or Ab, do NOT take this class, skip to Spanish 30.  This class is literally Spanish Aa and Ab squeezed into one semester.  I did not learn a single new thing this semester, in fact my Spanish is worse off now than it was at the end of last semester.","A good class for improving Spanish speaking, reading, and writing ability. Great way to sure up mediocre knowledge of the language. Not at all hard.","The class teaches Spanish while exploring cultural aspects of the Spanish speaking world.  Can be a ton of fun depending on your TF","Spanish was easily the best class that I took in my first semester in college. The TF (Humberto Delgado) was the most \"chill\" TF that you could ask for, who was always willing to help and give amazing feedback when you request it. We don't just learn Spanish either--we also discuss some sensitive political topics, such as immigration and the dictatorships. You are expected to discuss about these topics in Spanish every day (which is a really god thing!). Yes, I do recommend this class with enthusiasm.","unless u need a language requirement then dont take it. its boring.","The class is a step above first level Spanish, so it moves a little faster, but it is a great course to take before moving on in the language.","Veyr good review if you are not sure if you want to rush into a higher level spanish, but have been exposed to the language before.","It is a great class if you are comfortable in spanish but still need improvment","The material is interesting, but it is poorly taught and you should rely heavily on outside sources to help you learn the material.","This class is a great way to improve your Spanish fundamentals.","What can I say? If you want to learn Spanish, take this class. If you don't, then don't.","The course was not helpful in my fluency of Spanish.  I learned a lot of grammar rules that I will probably forget and do not feel that I can speak Spanish in a conversation better than when I started the course.","Spanish is a very important language to master to be a part of the future United States and world. This is an excellent first step.","Great Class and very easy","Senorita Castanyer is tough, but you learn more than you ever realized and end up loving her for her tough love and sense of humor. She truly cares about her students. So while the semester wasn't always easy, I learned so much and have come out a stronger student in spanish and in general.","Go to office hours for your compositions- you'll get a lot of useful feedback that will help you get a better grade before you even turn it in.","This class is fun and you learn more than just the language. I know more about the Spanish culture and history now, as well as having better spanish speaking and writing skills.","This course is fun and fairly easy.","The class is very helpful if you are interested in Spanish.","take it 100% SO fun!","Work load very manageable. Easy class if you had a Spanish background in high school.","This class was wonderful! I moved down from Spanish 30 and this class was just what I needed. The Prof Diaz really worked to make sure we understood everything and she didn't make us feel like we were dumb for asking what something means or asking for further elaborations on her explanations. She was very happy to help outside of class, too!","Great Teacher, definitely take this class!","If you are going to take this course, get in the mindset early that you want to speak a lot in class.  If you don't speak a lot and work on your conversation skills, then this course isn't very beneficial at all.  I consider myself good at writing in Spanish, but my conversation skills are definitely lacking.  I'm somewhat shy to speak in Spanish, so I didn't get the benefit of improving in that sense over the semester.  Thus, I don't really feel like I accomplished much with this other than keeping my high school Spanish skills refreshed.  I don't feel like I actually improved very much.","This class will greatly improve your speaking skills.","Great class. Painless.","Spanish C is a great class. The material about Spanish culture is really interesting, and it is great to get to know your small class well, while improving your speaking ability.","Spanish C is a great class.  If you can, get Professor Gutierrez.  I know people who have had other teachers and have not had as good of an experience as I have.  Gutierrez really helped me improve my Spanish and she is so fun and nice.  Going to this class was a pleasure, not a chore.","Wonderful class--especially if you have Glenda!  You will love her, you will love Spanish; you will laugh, smile, learn, and enjoy the entire semester in this class!!","good class if you like spanish. depends on your TF","It's intermediate Spanish.","It will be one of your most chill classes!","keep up with compositions and study vocab","This class fosters a love for the language.","Not as easy as people make it out to seem.","Very fun and interesting class, but make sure you take the time to understand the readings so you can actively participate in class discussions.","The class is very easy, if you keep up with the work. An enjoyable class overall.","This class is great for improving grammar skills and literature comprehension. The poetry and stories are interesting, and the tests are manageable. Great class!","The teachers are patient and understanding and help you do well in the course, making it a class with a lighter workload.","Take Ab instead of C.","This course is great for someone wanting to reach the point where they can begin to be conversationally fluid in Spanish, and teaches you pretty much all the grammar necessary to read sufficiently.","I would say that your experience in this class depends largely on your TF.","If you have a fairly strong background in Spanish (more than a year of previous instruction) or just feel up to the challenge, I would jump right into Spanish 30. Spanish C is fun, relaxed, and not very challenging. That being said, you do review and learn a lot of grammar and verb tenses. I also enjoyed the class curriculum, which focuses on Spanish and Latin American culture. However, I would have liked the opportunity to practice speaking more.","As a grad student taking the course, it's a bit odd to have such regimentation. Exams, essays, powerpoint presentations.","I was surprisingly pleased with the material and structure of this course. Although Spanish didn't fulfill any requirements for me, I found the course justified itself. I thought it would be a typical language (grammar) course, but instead, there was a heavy cultural, historical, and literature component. Personally, I thought that made the experience far more worthwhile. Prisca, my teacher, was also amazing. \r\nPlease don't take it at 9 am, though. It's hard to put together a sentence in English that early, let alone Spanish.","The course is not difficult, but make sure to have the motivation to do outside studying and readings.","This was a great first class coming out of high school Spanish.  Even after taking AP Spanish, this was the right first step for me.  The concepts and grammar are mostly all review, however the simple act of practicing Spanish daily was the most helpful.  All work is with groups and you are rarely put on the spot.","The professor is amazing and she's an effective teacher. The class is interactive and engaging","Overall a pretty easy class, the grading system is not very harsh. In order to participate in class, though, you need to do the readings. You also need to go to class every day.","The course is very well structured and discussion in spanish is very useful and well facilitated. It is easy to learn the concepts and the course work is manageable.","It's a lot of work outside of class","This course reinforces basic grammar very well.","Take this class to strength you listening and writing skills in Spanish.","Spanish C is a pretty easy class. The grammar is really simple but the stories and poems are difficult and cryptic...aka...if you don't tell YOUR TF's interpretation on the test...you will get counted off...so say what they want you to, regardless of what you actually think haha. it's a nice place to start your spanish speaking career in college.","This is a great course! It is not difficult and it gives you a chance to really improve your spanish.","know spanish","Expect to do some work each day.  You can fall behind pretty quick if you don't.  The course is reasonable and teaches you a lot, but if you're rusty like I was you might have trouble catching up.  The reading material is really good, and you're well-immersed in the class (very little English except for issues of translation).","This is a very good class to take for your language requirement or just to gain knowledge of the Spanish language.","Great course for improving Spanish.","Spanish C has been one of my favorite classes at Harvard. Martha is fantastic and is such a joy to have as a teacher.","Although I personally do not enjoy learning a foreign language, if that subject is something that you find appealing this is a very fun course. Again, most of the issues I have with the course come from my personal difficulty in learning a foreign language and not from the course itself.","This class is not too intense, and can even be fun. I enjoyed learning Spanish and about Latin American culture in this class. I would recommend that anyone interested in Spanish at this level or anyone who needs to fulfill a foreign language requirement take this class. This class is a low pressure way to learn a new language.","Spanish C is a lot harder than I thought going in. You read real literature and are expected to understand it. The conversations are about real issues, and you spend your time debating and analyzing the literature, rather than learning basic conversation. It is a good class, with lots of work, and you will learn as much as you do the homework.","Great way to learn. Not too hard.","I went into the course with taking for spanish for three years but not my senior year. Therefore, I did not take AP. I found that I knew all the grammar points described in this course, but my speaking and writing was not up to par with the course. I wish I had taken AB first to improve that, because I do not think I improved either much in this course. Instead, I was graded at the C level when my writing and speaking was at the AB level.","It's a great course with a very manageable workload.","Be prepared to be in class four days a week.","I really improved my Spanish in this class.  It wasn't too difficult, but it was challenging enough to really help me without me actually noticing.","This class was awesome. You definitely have to work every day (instead of just for big assignments), but it isn't too much work all at once and it is super rewarding and fun.","Fun! Great way to learn Spanish. Very involved. Loved it!","Its greatest weakness is lack of organization."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["So much fun!

The course was a challenge, but very fun!","This course is a lot of fun and definitely improves conversational spanish!","This class really gave me an excellent foundation on Spanish, and the TFs really want you to do well.","This class is great! Easy and relaxing but I still learned a lot!","Take it!","This is a good class to pratice spanish and to reinforce your skills, but it does not necessarily teach new material. It tends to be heavily based on literature, so you will need to spend time reading through the activities and being prepared to discuss spanish literature in class. Overall, it is a good class and I recommend it for students wanting to have a good grasp of spanish.","It's a painless and enjoyable way to fulfill a language requirement. Also Spanish is incredibly useful allover the world. Overall a good class choice.","It's your average Spanish class. You get out as much as you put in. It's easy to slide by and get good grades without doing too much work, but you won't improve your Spanish.","This course takes what you've previously learned in Spanish (in terms of grammar, etc.) and allows you to apply it via a mixture of activities structured around language, culture, and literature.  The different units covered in Spanish C provide interesting readings concerning issues of contemporary and historical significance (as well as some fiction, too), and the course allows for discussion or debate to take place surrounding issues relevant in the modern day.","helps expose you to important historical events as well as current issues involving spanish","This is a fantastic course.  It was one of the best I've taken at Harvard.  The class is small, you have fun in class and you learn while having fun.

Do not take this class if you cannot take time for it every single day. Otherwise, it could turn out enjoyable.","good class to finish language requirement","Depends on your section leader. I had Glenda. I've taken three years of spanish, and this was the first spanish class I've ever enjoyed. Awesome.","Language classes are so much fun!  There is still work, but you get to know your classmates in a totally different way, and the classes are always so enjoyable!","It's one of the most entertaining and valuable classes I have taken at Harvard. It was a really wonderful course, I would strongly recommend it.","Know your grammar!","It was fine, but not very engaging or useful.","Spanish C is a bit more difficult and serious than Spanish Ab, but you will grow tremendously as a spanish student.","This is a great class as long as you keep up with the grammar and readings.","I can't testify to the experiences of other students in other sections, but I loved Spanish C. I think most of this had to do with my TF Martha. She really helped to get discussion going in the class, didn't judge our levels, and she is overall one of the nicest people I have met. I took this class at 9 a.m., and I never once did not want to go. That is saying a lot about this course. It was absolutely enjoyable! Honestly, this was my favorite class of the semester.","It's a good class","I thought the course was great!","This course has very little structure. Although many TF's are great, you pretty much won't learn anything new from class and will be forced to learn on your own.","A fun, simple, and relaxing class. Take if you want balance. Take if you want an A.","fun and interesting - will definitely help you improve your spanish.","Spanish C was one of the best experiences I had this semester. Celeste Moreno is the best instructor I could have ever asked for. My Spanish speaking ability has improved. Prepare to interact with the material and engage in classroom discussions.

You will learn a lot! Don't miss out on taking a language course here!","I LOVE SPANISH!","Some of the readings in addition to Espana Hoy will make you feel bad about your Spanish skills but with a good section leader you will understand in no time.

Make sure, however, not to take this class if you cannot understand conversational Spanish.","Martha was the nicest and most caring instructor I have had here at Harvard.  She brings tremendous energy to the classroom and constantly makes sure that everybody is on the same page before continuing to a new lesson. Spanish is such a fun language to learn and this course gives you the right tools to practice speaking and writing it well, from the funny videos to the interesting stories to the interactive writing exercises.  Take this class if you have taken Spanish Aa\/Ab here at Harvard or have had  a ton of experience with Spanish during at least high school.","Best language course I have ever taken.

With this type of course, you get back from it what you put in.  At the end of the semester, you will be much better in Spanish if you put the effort in and do the small assignments and Repaso Activities and review.","The nightly workload is light, though you will certainly benefit if you take the time to read the poems and stories. Speaking up in class can be difficult if you have people in your class with more experience speaking the language, so if you're not confident in your speaking skills I'd suggest practicing a little before taking the class. Glenda is great though, very helpful and cheerful!","It isn't the most organized course in the spanish department, but a necessary evil to get to the more fun advanced courses. Less hand-holding than aa and ab, but you still have to do annoying grammar exercises.","Martha is a fantastic teacher and this is a great course.

If you actively take part in class and take part in discussions, the class is more enjoyable and you will learn more.","It is a fair class that instructs well on the language.","This class needs to decide whether it's a language class or a literature class. You'll spend most of your time reading short essays in Spanish, then struggling to talk about and analyze them in class. Grammar lessons are thrown in haphazardly and not integrated into the larger course material; you won't get much practice with all the new verb forms. I would recommend not taking this class until they overhaul it; it's moderately easy, but will make you want to thump your head again a wall.","It is all dependent on your TF and the students in your class.

Really great review if you an a little shaky on intermediate spanish.","Great class, though be prepared because the amount of work (from homework and frequent readings) required is definitely greater than in Spanish Aa or Spanish Ab.","Spanish C is a great way to immerse oneself in the Spanish language.

Even if she teaches the section at 7 am or at 11 pm take it with her ! \r\nShe's the best. Martha was probably the best teacher I have ever had in my whole life (in Lebanon and at Harvard). Super energetic, friendly and helpful. She explains clearly and in a fun way words we didn't understand.

She is so great and doesn't speak in English, which sounds lame but is actually crucial.","Great class to practice and improve one's Spanish speaking abilities","The manner in which the curriculum seamlessly integrates issues of social justice, latino history, and current concerns - such as environmentalism and immigration - keeps the course engaging and learning the language exciting; it provides a window to the importance of learning the Spanish language for real-world applications, such as in public health or immigrant law.","I would not suggest taking this class to learn spanish.  If you already know spanish, you could take it in order to pass your foreign language requirement, or to polish your skills up to a more academic level, but I feel like it would be more useful and less frustrating to simply read a lot of spanish newspapers, converse casually with spanish speaking friends, or watch spanish videos in order to learn the language.","This class is fun as long as you actually make friends with people in your section and your TF. The only way the class can be bad is if you don't have any enthusiasm.","the class is really poorly put together","It is spanish... not too much difference from Spanish AB, but more is expected of you","Take this course if you are willing to put in the effort, its value is only as much work as you are willing to put into it","This is a good class, but it's a bit too much unnecessary work at times. I would recommend this course if you were guaranteed to have Prisca as a TF, but that's not how it works so I would just recommend requesting her. The material is interesting but I'm not sure how much my spanish really improved from AB","This class goes through all the past and subjunctive and perfect tenses. It goes through them pretty fast, but I thought this was helpful because it made it easier to remember the differences between them all. There's homework basically every night but not a ton of it. The class takes place all in Spanish, which I found stressful at first, but by the end it was no problem at all.","Always do the readings before class! Otherwise, you might struggle to understand what's going on.","You'll love it!","The class will definitely improve your Spanish speaking, writing, listening, and reading skills a LOT. However, it's a bit high pressure for a language course, and takes a lotttt more time outside of class than Spanish Ab. GET MARTHA AS A TF. In the beginning of the semester I literally spent the first two weeks switching sections a million times and trying out EVERY section leader and she was the only one I liked so I stayed in that one despite it being at 9am it was worth it. She's so nice and funny and an expert on how to teach Spanish...she always knows exactly what to do and say to push your Spanish to the next level.","It's hard to get up for at 9 AM, but it's worth it :)","It is a great class, especially if you plan on receiving a language citation.","Great class, especially if your instructor is as amazing as Glenda!","This class is basically a repeat of Spanish Ab. There are some interesting readings.","Can't get around taking it if you need the credit. This class focuses a lot on reading and writing skills.","The professor was outstanding but the class seemed a little easy.","A lot of reading comprehension","Take Spanish C with Martha! She makes waking up at 9am worth it. I switched into Martha's section, and it was the best decision. She truly cares about helping you learn and is such a caring teacher. She made me love Spanish and want to continue in it. Bottom line: GET MARTHA!","Great Spanish course.","If you want to learn Spanish then Spanish C is a must","Take a lower level if possible. I was placed into Ab, so I took that and got an A, but everyone in my C class was better at spanish than I was. People take lower levels than they should. The kids in my class should have been in 30 or 40. I had two years of high school spanish in 9th and 10th grade and I took Ab then C. I know a girl who is practically fluent who was placed into 40 but took Aa. Spanish Ab and C would have been appropriate for me if everyone just took the course they were placed into, but people just want to compete against less prepared people, so it makes me look dumb and it's discouraging.","This course provides a comprehensive review of Spanish grammar and uses very interesting materials.","Try to get Profesora Diaz as your section leader. She is amazing, enthusiastic, and the nicest person ever!","fun!!","If you have a decent background in Spanish the class will be easy.","GLENDA IS THE GREATEST!","Glenda is a wonderful person who cares about her students. However, I don't feel prepared for Spanish 30.","Get in the habit of printing everything in advance.","This course does a good job reviewing grammar and exposes you to a variety of Spanish writers, thinkers, and activists, as well as topical issues in the Spanish-speaking community. However, if you are looking to improve your conversational skills, this is not the best place to do that. There is a much greater emphasis on reading and writing than there is on speaking.","I took this class after taking Acd, and was very disappointed in the lack of motivation in my fellow classmates.  While I thought that the review of grammar was useful, the lack of enthusiasm about the spanish language was contagious, and I found myself exerting less and less effort as the semester continued.  It's nothing that the professors can change, but I would not take this class as an elective if you want to be surrounded by motivated students.","If you want to know spanish, take this class.","It was a lot of fun and a great way to learn spanish.","This is a very challenging course with all of the readings we had to analyze.","If you need a Spanish class for requirements, this is (from what I've heard) the last one that focuses primarily on speaking\/grammar rather than literary analysis and such. If you are more of a practical person in regards to languages, this class is definitely still of use.","This is supposed to be an easy class, but can be deceptively time consuming since the class really requires that you put in daily work. If you are serious about becoming more fluent in spanish, it will take more hours of work outside of class. Overall, it is still a good and not too difficult class to take","You will have to use the Repaso to teach\/reteach some of the basic grammar skills. But it is an effective tool to test yourself and see if you understand the concept."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This class is you typical Spanish class. You'll learn all of the major points (everything from present tense, briefly, to subjunctive was covered). It is not an extremely difficult class, but you will have to put in a fair amount of work if you want to get an A. The tests consist of a lot of writing (sometimes over half of the points), so be prepared for that. The grammar points are taught rather quickly because you only have one semester, but the lessons are thorough and all powerpoints and worksheets are available online. There is a few pages of reading most nights, that vary from poems to stories (sometimes listening exercises as well), and these are then discussed in class the next day. Because these classes are taught in section, it often depends who your teacher is. I had Martha, and she was an amazing teacher. She was so sweet and genuinely cared about all of her students. Class with her was so much fun. Sometimes foreign language teachers can make speaking in class intimidating, but Martha did exactly the opposite. Her kind disposition facilitates participation. Your Spanish will improve from this class, as will your passion for the Spanish language.","In this class, grammar is not the focus.  Grammar is important, but if you feel a bit rusty with it, you're definitely not going to get a comprehensive review by taking this class.  That being said, the texts that you read in this class are very interesting, and tests are not overly difficult.","The only way to learn a language is to put time into it.","I would tell them that the class is not too challenging, but it still has gains and makes you a better speaker and writer in spanish.","It is mostly a review class, but it made me comfortable using the more complex grammar in conversation.","Read the texts; they can be interesting! Speak up in class too; you need to practice to improve your speaking skills. :)","This class is a lot of work both in terms of class time and outside assignments, but I felt like my fluency and comprehension improved significantly over the course of the semester, and the non-grammar content of the course makes it interesting.","My background in Spanish was 5 years of overall mediocre Spanish teaching. I didn't get to take Spanish my senior year in highschool, meaning I'd lost a lot of my vocabulary set, and grammar knowledge coming in to the class. But don't let my extensive background intimidate you, if you have taken at least 1 years of solid Spanish teaching, (i.e. conducted completely in Spanish with no dictionaries available), then you should be fine. All that being said, it was an excellent course. If you read the readings and actively engage in class you should be fine.","This class is a lot of work. I would still recommend it though because learning a language is such an amazing opportunity and Spanish C improved my Spanish in very noticeable ways.","A review of a lot of spanish grammar with an emphasis on spanish literature as well - nothing too difficult.  It was a little overwhelming at first, but you get the hang of it and it is a very rewarding class.  Don't be intimidated after the first week of class - it gets easier.","This class is great for improving your Spanish-speaking skills, though be prepared to have classmates that vary in terms of skill. Also, Eugenio is fantastic; he's very engaging in class and imbues his enthusiasm and passion for Spanish in his students. It's truly a joy to attend his class.","This class is a great, pretty relaxed intermediate Spanish class. I learned a lot about Spanish culture, while also improving my grammar and vocabulary skills.","This class is fairly strong overall. It is definitely the best language course I have taken so far. The opportunity to speak, read, and write with regularity really does improve your Spanish skills.","The class was fun, but it was not a breeze.  If you can choose between professors in any way, Glenda Quinonez is an extraordinary professor. She made the class a fun and friendly place to learn.  This course is certainly not a bad way to fill your language requirement.","If you took Spanish in high school and were never taught in the Spanish language this is a good course as far as promoting you to speak in the language and review all the different conjugations for verbs. If you put in the time on assignments and in class participation you will b able to succeed in the course.","This course is heavily focused on grammar and readings. The end of the year is very hectic because of a written exam, oral exam, final paper, and a final project!","Try and avoid taking C if you can. No fun.","Get Eugenio as your instructor!","Be prepared to have a lot of work to do.","Glenda is great!","Glenda is a great preceptor.  If you get her, Spanish C will be awesome.  If not...","Make sure to keep up with all of the assignments on the course website.","If you want to continue learning spanish, and Spanish C aligns with your prior knowledge of the language, then be prepared to participate in thorough conversation and oral analysis of spanish literary works for daily classes, and to study grammar for tests.","Easy if you've taken Spanish in high school. If you do the work and put in time you'll do well.","There is a great deal of outside preparation and study which is necessary to do well in this class, but given dedication and time, the course really pushes your Spanish language skills and helps to advance the understanding of the language.","This class expands Spanish skills very effectively. If you plan to study abroad or truly learn Spanish, this class is the place to start. It could be fairly difficult if you are just trying to fulfill the language requirement.","It is much more difficult than typical high school language class. However, it provides many different ways to master the material and improve your grade.","This class was excellent. The workload was manageable and the readings and discussion topics were interesting (immigration, cultural stereotypes, etc.) You are reading in spanish, though, so some reading background could be useful. Definitely try to get Eugenio as a TF, he is so nice and incredibly willing to help students.","Take this class. It is a good starting point in order to obtain a language citation in Spanish. Get ready to speak at all times while in class. At times it was easy for me (have had over 9 years of Spanish), but still the cultural concepts that Professor Lopez brings to class are not only very intriguing, but also interesting and there really was never a dull moment in this class. If you took spanish for the majority of your high school career this class may be a bit easy for you, but I still would recommend taking it.","Its super fun! Really chill, feels like a high school class. Low stress language requirement.","Martha is an incredible teacher.  She is so funny, kind, wonderful, and makes sure that each person learns in her class.","It's great","Though the course may seem a bit daunting at first, my TA was extremely helpful and made sure everyone understood the readings and felt comfortable speaking. My Spanish skills dramatically improved after taking this class.","Make sure you get in Glenda's section--Glenda is the BEST! She is really awesome and you'll learn a lot.  She's very smart, kind, caring, and fun! She was very understanding about students' concerns.  She would also bring in food and treats often!","This class has a high time commitment, but the work is not particularly difficult and I felt that my Spanish abilities really improved.","Good class, but a lot of literature readings and assignments that pop out at you. We had 4 midterms, 4 papers, 2 orals, a field trip, etc... so it does add up. Still a very manageable and interesting 4th class though.","If they want to learn spanish while at Harvard, this class is a great way to help you move from a beginner to a respectable level of proficiency.","Absolutely take it. I hated the class at first but towards the end I loved it","Even though the material may be difficult, there is never any stress involved with the course and you are sure to succeed if you put in the effort.","Great way to hone Spanish in a fun, engaging environment. Focus is on learning and the teachers genuinely care.","Glenda is excellent, but I found the class rather boring","Enjoyable, but LOTS harder than AB","It's a great course! Not only expands your knowledge of spanish as a language but it will also familiarize you with important and influential individuals and themes of the spanish culture.","This is a decent course, you will receive a solid Spanish review. It is, however, slightly disorganized. The teachers do their best with the materials given.","Your experience in this class is entirely dependent on your TF. I had a different TF for a few days before I got switched to Glenda's section, and I can tell you that my experience in the class improved by 5-fold. Realize that class sizes are highly variable. My section had only 10 students, but I do know of sections with around 20.","The challenge of being around spanish a lot more than I was in high school was worth it. I learned a lot about the cultural backgrounds of spanish speakers, as this class puts more import on the role of spanish in the world and the United States than on speaking spanish.","This class provided a nice overview and review of the Spanish language. It helped me strengthen my grammar and build upon my vocabulary, and it helped me in speaking, too. Class material was a bit disorganized, and I wish the class had more of a grammar\/vocabulary focus. However, for somebody who had not spoken Spanish in a full year, this class was a nice review. Eugenio is absolutely the man; if you can take the class with him, seriously, seriously do it. He made this class one of my most enjoyable of the semester.","It's a fun relaxed class.","Stay on top of Repaso, review material often even when a quiz is not in the near future","get ready to work but it is so worth it. you spanish will improve so much","This class was very fun, relaxed, and one of the best you will find at Harvard. I was excited to come to class, and it pushed me to speak and use my Spanish, when before I was very shy.","Be prepared for a lot of work, but work that will benefit your use and practice of Spanish.","I absolutely loved Spanish C. Carlos is an amazing professor and class was entertaining and relatively stress free. We put our desks in a circle every day and were able to have really interesting discussions. This environment also helped me to become more comfortable speaking Spanish on the spot. Take this course!","It is a great class that actually gets you analysing real stories and cultural topics, as opposed to just the grammar.","This is a great course. Eugenio is a wonderful T.F. and made section fun and informative. I would caution those who may not feel as comfortable with Spanish. I really do think that people need to be at a conversational level to get the most out of this course. That being said, my T.F. was incredibly helpful, and I learned a lot just by going to his office hours.","I was quite impressed with my experience in this class.  My main complaint regarding high school Spanish classes was the lack of actual speech in the class, and that was definitely not the case here.  The readings were varied and culturally relevant, and the issues mattered.  This is not a boring foreign language class of the three Fs, Flags, Festivals, and Food.  Be prepared to put in a moderate amount of effort, and you will gain much from this class.","Loved this class. Marianna is awesome and you really get to practice\/polish your spanish. This was my first spanish class at Harvard and I will definitely be taking more after C.","It's a good way to practice Spanish. The instructor breezed over grammar assuming most of it was a review, so having taken a prior class is definitely necessary.","Very good intro Spanish class. You definitely want to take this class by the horns and utilize your TF because this is definitely the best way to learn and improve your Spanish. Speaking should be your focus.","Look over the syllabus, and make sure you're shopping the right level, but the class is valuable and informative. Prof. Martha Diaz is one of the best, most wonderful teachers I've had in my whole life. If you can get in her section, do not pass it up.","Too much busywork and many of the writing assignments more or less required the student to rehash the instructor's left-wing politics.","This class is a great way to improve your Spanish and also appreciate some attendant hispanic culture.  The instructor is very warm, helpful, and knowledgeable.  Make sure to practice your Spanish before taking this class, or it will prove challenging.","I thought the professor was very adept at teaching this course and I would recommend students to take the course with him.","If you took a few years of high school Spanish and would like a brief review of it just for pleasure, or if you have to fulfill the language requirement, or if you'd like to pursue a language citation from Harvard, then this is the course for you. The material is easy to manage and comprehend. The grammar review is comprehensive and covers almost every tense in the Spanish language, except for a few of the really advanced ones. I really loved the readings for this course: they touched-on things like the pros and cons of bilingual education, affirmative action, immigration, exploitation, slavery, discrimination, patriarchy, dictatorships, and fiction. Expect to do just a few workbook exercises per night (or less), and to have to read a fairly short reading by the next class (usually no more than 4 pages in Spanish). You will also write 4 short essays (about 2 pages each, all in Spanish) that cover texts and various topics that you are currently covering (these help a lot with studying for the tests that you will have to take over the semester, of which there are 4). You will also have to give one oral presentation (with someone) and there is also a pretty quick final project that won't have you stressing out much at all, I promise! The section leaders speak only in Spanish, and participation in Spanish counts for 25% of your grade, so if you feel that you are not at that level of comprehension or confidence in your speaking yet, then consider the next lowest level from Spanish C. My section leader (Mariana) spoke very clearly and at a pace that all the students could understand, though I'm sure she could have spoken much faster if she wanted to. In this aspect, the focus is on comprehending carefully and then responding to her questions in your own words in Spanish. I feel much more confident in my comprehension and speaking skills since taking this course, too, and feel ready for Spanish 30. Recommend with enthusiasm!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Make sure you can read well in Spanish before you take this class. There are a lot of required readings.","This course is not difficult. The work is totally manageable and classes are interesting because of lots of discussion and group work. If you participate in class then you will greatly improve in your speaking and understanding of the language. Maria is a fantastic TF who is willing to help you whenever you need it for whatever issues you have. She also just has a great personality which really makes class a lot better so you should definitely try to get her.","Hopefully, you will have the opportunity to take this class with Martha Diaz. She has a passion for teaching and truly makes everyday of Spanish wonderful. This class is a step up from ab, but it seems like a natural progression. The literature you read is interesting; presentations are fun. It was nice having class 4 days a week, because it provided structure to my weekly routine. I would definitely recommend this course.","I took this class to fulfill the language requirement, and it was generally a breeze. Very interesting readings.","Cesar is very enjoyable as a preceptor. Try to always come prepared as its difficult to partake in a discussion in a different lesson if you're lost.","A good grade is attainable if you are willing to put in the effort!","Make sure you get Maria as a TF--she's fantastic and cares about her students! Also, keep in mind that this is a review class, so you won't learn any new grammar\/grammar that you didn't already cover in Aa and Ab.","Not too bad, try to get Prof. Ram\u00c3\u00adrez-Lopez if you can, she really cares about her students and puts in a huge effort to make sure that they succeed.","You'll fulfill you're foreign language requirement.","The instructors are great, but the class comes with a heavy workload.","It's awesome","don't spend all your time on this course.","This is a jump from Spanish Ab, but it is doable","Noticeably tougher than AB, although the topics are pretty much the same.","Eugenio is awesome!!","This is similar to spanish AB except more lecture and discussion oriented.","This course allows you to explore you speaking skills in an environment that promotes learning.  It is a lot of fun and the students generally make the class.","This class is relatively easy if you took AP in high school. Grammar is not thouroughly taught, it is expected you learn it on your own time. Class is not 100% to learning the material. But overall a good class.","This class is A LOT of work but I think it's necessary to become fluent in another language.","The only bad part of this class is that it meets four times a week and the sections are sometimes on the boring side, but it's not too much work and helps with learning Spanish.","I think your experience in this class would really depend on your TF. I was really really lucky to have Eugenio Lanzas, probably one of the nicest faculty members Harvard has. He's friendly, encouraging, and lenient. He creates a learning environment, not a testing environment. I appreciate that.","Take this class! This class is the perfect way to improve your spanish through daily classes which are always enjoyable and productive. You won't regret it by the end of term when you can look back on how much you have learnt.","Spanish is a really good course. Profesora Ramirez is great and leads interesting discussions in class. You will learn a lot of Spanish and will get familiar with the hispanic culture.","Good course. Carlos is great.","Pretty hard","The course is fine and the TFs are pretty good.  The course materials are a random collection of poems, stories, and worksheets assembled together by nothing other than a page of links on the course site, and we are expected to print them all and bring them to class, which is a pain in the ass because it becomes messy and hard to keep track of.  The course should assemble a course packet at the beginning of the course and distribute it to students for free.  After all, the Spanish department does have a photocopier...  Also, at the end of the course, I had the written final, oral final, fourth composition, and extra credit project all due within the course of three days.  That is unacceptable.  Anyway, these are complaints directed toward the course head.  For students, I don't regret taking this course -- I needed to for the language requirement and it's easy enough to make it through.","If you've taken Spanish Ab: it's a step up from Ab, definitely more intensive and a bit more difficult, but also a lot more enjoyable.\r\nIf you haven't taken Ab: you should be very comfortable speaking Spanish in a group setting and you should be confident in your comprehension skills because EVERYTHING is in Spanish, from the syllabus to directions on exams to grammar explanations.","It is an okay class, but you need to be able to learn quickly and on your own.","Very interesting class, good exposure to a variety of Spanish literature","You get out of this class what you put in.  You can get away with not doing much work regularly, but then you just have to prepare for the quizzes and put effort into the compositions.","I loved taking Spanish C, I thought my TF was lovely and I wish I could have more classes like it","Espanol C fue mi clase favorita este semestre pasado. Really! It was a lot of fun, and your spanish will improve considerably. If you have at least 2 or 3 years of high school experience, shop the class. You won't regret it.","Eugenio is an amazing teacher.  There is a fair amount of work, but if you keep up with it and participate then it pays off.","This class is good, especially if you can understand Spanish speakers, if not it is still good if you are pretty good at writing and reading Spanish.","I really enjoyed this class, and I would definitely recommend it.","This is a really good course, and especially Eugenio makes it enjoyable. The workload is seriously a breeze. The tests are fairly easy. It's definitely worth taking.","Spanish C is a great continuation from Spanish 5\/6.  You receive a wonderful reintroduction to some topics and the continuation into subjunctive and harder topics at the end.","It was really fun, not a lot of work, and I feel like I really improved my Spanish skills.","This class is a great way to further your spanish speaking capabilities!","Make sure to do the reading.","great spanish intermediate level class","Spanish C is an amazing course, my favorite this semester, especially with EUGENIO LANZAS, the BEST TF EVER. He was so funny, kind, efficient, organized, and enthusiastic. He always provided great, timely feedback. He was also really supportive and just a wonderful guy in general. He also stirred up a love for Spanish literature in me during this course - his love of literature and literary analysis definitely carried over to our readings of Borges or Neruda and I felt so much more enlightened about vocabulary and the possibility of great eloquence in the Spanish language. An all around incredible course.","Eugenio is great! He is the nicest person, so helpful, accommodating, and patient. He is a great teacher and really wants all of his students to have a good grasp on the material before exams. The course itself is not very demanding, but there is a good amount of material to keep up with in order to be prepared for class. However, readings are generally short and interesting. This class is not much harder than Ab, just more reinforcement\/application of grammar to reading and writing (mostly reading) rather than being taught new grammar. Very fun class, not stressful at all!","there is not enough emphasis on GRAMMAR, which can leave you on ice on the exams.\r\nthe texts are FANTASTIC, cover a range of themes and the literary analysis is great\r\nalso, some of the homework can be pointless","This class will definitely give you a great understanding of Spanish and provide an environment in which your reading and speaking capabilities can improve. However, the environment in which this class will be taken is hit or miss. You may have engaged classmates and a TF you love who will make the class extra fantastic, but this is not a guarantee.","As long as you do your work and always participate in class, you'll do well!","Spanish C is a great place to start if you need to touch up on your grammar. You also learn about a lot of Hispanic\/Latino issues such as identity, immigration, etc. Unfortunately, if you get placed in a large class, you won't get much speaking practice.","Spanish C reviews grammar topics--it does not teach them. Do not hesitate to make mistakes and ask lots of questions in class! Plenty of great readings and very reasonable exams and papers. This class is a fantastic opportunity to strengthen high school language skills and prepare for a college literature class.","It is tough at first, but it is very enjoyable ultimately and you learn to speak a little bit better in Spanish, which is helpful for understanding too.","Cesar Perez is a great TF. Learned a lot of spanish","Not worth the time. You are better off skipping it and going to study abroad and take the equivalent there!","Spanish C is definitely a very challenging course, and the instructors generate such enthusiasm for the language. It has definitely been one of my favorite courses at Harvard, and I am so glad I took it. My advice is to take this class and be ready to work hard.","The readings of the course were interesting and the workload very manageable. The class often felt disorganized, though; I longed for clearer assignment sheets and a course pack with all of the content we needed.","Great class, but I was likely enough to have great a teacher. I had friends who had a much worse experience with a different teacher. Make sure you get along with and like your instructor.","Most of the emphasis in class is actually on reading and writing in Spanish and not speaking in Spanish, which can be a good thing in that it's less pressure; however, it doesn't really develop my speaking skills, which is very problematic.","The literature read in the course is very interesting with beautiful phrasing that embraces the language.","Martha is definitely one of my favorite teachers of all time. She really gets everyone to participate in class and is always encouraging. She is a genuinely nice and caring person who wants everyone in her class to improve their Spanish. Your pronunciation and ability to speak Spanish will improve considerably, especially if you take the extra effort to participate a lot. I loved this class. It has honestly made me think about perhaps minoring (getting a secondary field) in Spanish, but I'm definitely going to get a foreign language citation. Thanks Martha!","Much of the grammar and vocabulary will need to be reviewed independently. I don't feel that I learned to speak the language with greater fluency or strength. I would have liked to have more speaking practice each day.","This class is great if you're planning on taking Spanish classes at Harvard. If you can take it with Martha, definitely do; she's incredible! The work can get a little bit tedious but it's not time consuming or difficult. Definitely recommend!","This is a good class to hone your skills in both understanding and speaking spanish.","This is a good class to balance with hard science. It is interesting and your Spanish will really improve."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This class was not only easy but it was also enjoyable. David is a great TF who is always willing to help students. He grades very fairly and wants to see his students succeed and understand the material. There is not much work outside of class besides one or two workbook pages a night and possibly reading a story or short text for discussion. The tests were easy and the workload was not very high. I highly recommend the class and David as a TF.","This class is a really good way to practice speaking and review previously learned grammar.","This class will do great things for your speaking and writing abilities, as long as you put the effort in to do all the world and attempt to participate as much as you can in class. It's a good place in between an introductory class and the more advanced level, for someone who has had some spanish background, but would like a refresher on some important topics.","Spanish C is a good course for those who want to really establish an understanding of the basics or beginning and intermediate spanish before moving on. It's a pretty nicely structure class, aside from some bad listening assignments at the beginning.","If you get Paul Politte as your TF you are set.  He is a genuinely nice guy who wants to help everyone improve","Spanish C is a very worthwhile and enjoyable course that builds students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 knowledge of Spanish vocabulary and grammar. Be aware that the class requires a significant time commitment to do well and that your experience will depend on your section leader.","The course was hard but not overwhelming. Class discussions were always hard. I felt like participation was easy because involvement didn't feel forced. Some out of class work feels burdensome\/unnecessary, but overall the work prepares you to be a much better speaker, writer, and listener.","Section: very nice discussion type section, depends on your section leader though\r\nCompositions: not too difficult at all, work with your TF and you'll be solid\r\nTests: not too hard, but don't not study, studying is important to doing well\r\nHomework: very easy and enjoyable compared to other homework you may be doing (psets)\r\nProjects\/Presentations: easy to do, but don't put them off to the last minute, could be stressful\r\n\r\nOverall: great course and I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in learning more of the spanish language.","You can walk out of this class and know that your spanish has improved. It does a nice job of reinforcing all the grammar and introducing other linguistic subtleties. Also the textbook is excellent.","This class is enjoyable, and not terribly difficult -- the tests are not designed to trip you up. However, you will not learn any grammar. You will teach yourself the grammar from the textbook and in class do practice problems or discuss stories in Spanish. Your speaking abilities will certainly improve though.","The course material is great. However, your experience with Spanish will really depend on the TF that teaches it, the students in your class, and of course YOU. Learning spanish grammar is necessary, but what's really important is that you are learning how to use it in everyday speaking. Take advantage of every opportunity to speak in class!","I wouldn't recommend this course if you have a strong background in Spanish language--although I had passed out of this course, I still took it to reinforce my Spanish skills.  \r\n\r\nThis class did an excellent job in doing that, as my reading comprehension improved.\r\n\r\nThis class isn't the best way to expand your vocabulary, as little is done to reinforce the learning of new vocabulary unless you are committed to doing it on your own.","Paul is great, and my spanish improved immensely with the course. I can carry on real conversations now. Really thorough grammar review as well. Take it","Do not overestimate your Spanish ability. Although the Spanish Placement Test might tell you that you are ready for this course, proceed with caution. It is a course with an emphasis on speaking, which the placement test does not evaluate well, so make sure to take your abilities into account before enrolling.","Try to get Martha if you can; she is EXCELLENT. She will help you as much as you ask.","This class transformed my ability and confidence in communicating in Spanish. It is an extremely supportive environment where you can take chances, make mistakes, and get messy.","This class is amazing! 4 days a week was a little rough, but better than any spanish class I had taken before. I really think I'm a better spanish speaker because of it. Actually do the reading, IN SPANISH, don't look up translations. You become better at the language that way.","You should be prepared to converse often in Spanish. You can't get away with sitting in the back of class and never talking because there's only 15 students in the class.","It is not a lot of work and easy to well in as long as you go to class","Spanish C helps with conversing with others and reading spanish literature.","This class is great, it's super helpful and Paul is absolutely amazing. He's such a great guy and is always willing to help his students with any problems they may run into. The coursework is low, most of the out of class work is monotonous work in a workbook but the occasional projects were fun. Definitely take this class, I feel very prepared moving on to higher levels of spanish study.","It's a fun class and totally painless. If you find yourself struggling, turn to the Repaso book. If you don't, just relax and have fun!","If in doubt... TAKE THIS CLASS! As a biomedical engineering student who was wary of taking on non-science classes with a lot of time commitment, this was such an awesome choice. If you can get Martha as a TF, definitely go for it - she is such a sweetheart, and totally understanding in terms of - if you're like me - having difficulty listening and speaking the language. I thought the readings for the class were always super interesting, and tests\/quizzes were never something to stress about. Honestly, this is one of those great classes in which the work you put in has a direct correlation with what you get out of it. Not only was it a fun, relatively low-stress class, but I also feel like my spanish is so much better!","This class helped me improve my Spanish speaking and writing abilities in a low-stress environment with assignments that will never be extremely challenging.  Because of that, you get as much as you put into the course.","The classes seem pretty small and I appreciated that they focused more on speaking. Some of the poems that we read though seemed hard to interpret in English let alone in Spanish.","This course consists of a lot of reading and not nearly as much grammar as Spanish Aa and Ab. I would recommend having taken Ab or equivalent by the time you take this course.","Use very simple language and sentences when writing your essays - you won't get a better grade for using complex ideas or sentences.","I learned Spanish without being stressed out over the class.  Assignments were reasonable and my TF was very accessible and helpful.","Great class!","this class will help you relearn spanish you may have forgotten and solidify the grammar you need to know","This is an excellent way to solidify your fundamental Spanish-speaking ability. The readings and themes we engage with are are very interesting. By the end of the class, you will marvel at how much your Spanish has improved.","It was good language class. I greatly improved my spanish.","Muy bien.","read and the class is easy","Course was not very difficult if you have a good background and have taken Spanish before.","Get Andrew Gray as your TF. He is AMAZING and so invested in his students and seeing them learn and do well. He will be your advocate and he is super understanding and interested in the student as a person. Cannot recommend him enough.","I would assure prospective students that this course will further develop their Spanish skills without requiring undue hours upon hours of coursework.","Spanish C is fun and entertaining, and you are guaranteed to learn a lot of Spanish in it. If you get David Francis as your TF, you are lucky because he is spectacular.","This class is very manageable but it is important to have some background in Spanish. The teacher offers very useful resources to assist in learning the language and also raising interest in the subjects.","This class is taught differently than most high-school spanish classes and the writing and speaking components take it to another level. Be prepared to speak every day in class about your day, activities, politics and social events.","Well, it's an intermediate Spanish class - nothing unexpected. Prepare to learn all about immigration, concentration camps, poverty and dictatorships.","Spanish C is a lot of fun and not too difficult if you put the time in. It's just a small amount of homework almost every night but super manageable. I'm glad I continued with Spanish","I loved this class; it was very fun, workload wasn't too bad, and Paul was a very enthusiastic teacher.","Class 4 days may be annoying, but for a language course Spanish C stays pretty interesting.","Take it. Bang!","David Francis is great! The class was fun, I learned a lot about culture, and we practiced speaking all the time. I feel much more confident in my Spanish abilities.","I took 3 years of Spanish in high school and then took a year off my freshman year, but was still able to handle the course somewhat. I really think that you'd be much better served taking a lower-level class in the case that you've taken time off. I don't feel like my ability to speak spanish has progressed as much as I would like and this is largely due to a lack of involvement in the material due to feeling very lost at the beginning.\r\n\r\nIf I could make one recommendation, it would be to keep up with the work!! It really sneaks up on you if you don't take care to really do the compositions and grammar worksheets ahead of time.","Paul is the best!! Be prepared for homework everyday.","This class is very helpful for intermediate level spanish students","Great class for solidifying your spanish skills. It covers really interesting topics and gives a great introduction to spanish literature.","Prepare for the last week of the class having a lot of assignments. Don't procrastinate.","This class requires regular reading and studying for exams but it is a great way to learn Spanish.","The class is well-taught and moves at a brisk but manageable pace. I've heard that there are quite a few discrepancies between the grading for different sections so this may be something to investigate. The readings are very important for daily class discussion; if you don't do the readings you'll be completely lost.","The course covered many interesting and culturally-important readings and writers. Additionally, a broad range of important grammar topics were covered. The instructor was great and overall the class was relatively stress-free. As long as you put in the effort in your four compositions, study for the exams, and participate in class, you'll do very well.","This class is great for learning grammar but not so much for vocab.","It is a fun way to learn a second language! Take it!","This class is great for those who took at least a year or two of Spanish in high school and want to gain a solid fundamental ground for the essential grammar components of Spanish. I believe this course is a great transition into college language classes because it is about half focused on grammar (which will be familiar to most high schools students) and half focused on spanish culture and the hispanic experience, which I anticipate becoming the more prominent area of study in higher level language classes.","Be prepared to put a lot of time in this class- it's not easy.","This class is a fun way to gain a better familiarity with the Spanish language.","Solid grammar review. If you can already carry a decent conversation in Spanish, move on. Easy grading.","This is a great course for someone moving from the beginner to the intermediate level as it involves a lot of reading of poems and short stories with in-class discussions versus a grammar heavy daily discussion. Also, Paul was a wonderful TF who encouraged us to speak, make mistakes, and learn in the process.","A good amount of work should be put into conversing in spanish, because the course relies heavily on your ability to discuss controversial topics in spanish (which may be hard for people coming from spanish Ab).  It isn't a particularly hard course, and there isn't much work to do for it overall.","Spanish C is a great course if you want to reinforce what you learned in high school and become more comfortable with speaking Spanish. The topics we speak about are interesting and relevant, such as immigration, drug trafficking, and dictatorships. We learn how to speak about different things that actually happen in the world. There isn't a strong focus on vocabulary in this course though, which is a bit unfortunate."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This course provides quality instruction in the Spanish language. If you get a great professor like Andrew, it will be even better.","\u00c2\u00a1Bueno!","The teacher of this course was very enthusiastic and I really liked her.","Take this class. The Spanish language program here is pretty strong. Just hearing Martha speak in Spanish every day, and speaking entirely in Spanish in class really does give you firmer grasp of the language. Martha speaks VERY clearly - you should have no problems not understanding due to the traditional Spanish accent some section leaders from Spain have.","This course is a huge improvement from Spanish Ab - less annoying route exercises, more application of the language to a variety of situations. You engage with Spanish in so many different ways - interviews, history lessons, poems, short stories, music videos - which keeps things really fresh and is SUCH a step up from the mindnumbing flipping-through-the-textbook of more elementary classes. All the grammar rules you go through in this class are refreshers, not being taught as if you were learning it for the first time, so it is important to have some background, but if you do, you're going to learn so much more in this class (and more painlessly) than you would if you were taking Aa or Ab.","This class really helped me get better at reading and understanding Spanish. A very reasonable amount of work. Would definitely recommend.","This class is great; an awesome way to hone your speaking and grammar skills.","This is a big difference from Spanish Ab. This class will test your ability to speak comfortably in class. That's what we did in most of our sections. Exams are pretty easy. Compositions aren't bad to write but are graded harshly. Not only are they graded harshly, but it is an unclear grading system. I would just receive a paper back with a number at the top. How can someone improve if there are no comments? Material moves fast and it may be difficult to keep up if your Spanish is a bit slow. Ask questions.","As someone who took, and achieved highly in Spanish Ab, this course was very challenging. It is nice in that it takes a more cultural and literary approach to learning Spanish, but then exams roll around and are very heavily grammar based, which section isn't. Not a terrible course, but could be taught better. Also, being in a small section or with an easy section grader is a huge advantage.","This is a good intermediate level Spanish class. The readings in this class help you to advance your understanding and use of the language in a deeper way. There are some grammar review points, which is nice, but it is really a good class to begin to apply your knowledge to other areas.","Spanish C is a good, conversation and reading-based class that continues one's Spanish education nicely. It's not an absolute breeze, but you wouldn't be learning if it was!","great way to strengthen your speaking skills and grammar skills","It is more difficult that you would think. Make sure your spanish background from Spanish AB is strong and find ways to learn grammar. Put the time and effort in to the class and don't think you can get by with studying the night before the exam.","there are a ton of readings, try to keep up!","Enjoy it David is a phenomenal teacher","Spanish C is a fantastic class. I really enjoyed and I now feel comfortable speaking in spanish with strangers. I feel that I now have a working knowledge of the basic grammar of the language. Andrew Gray was an amazing TF and he really did a wonderful job getting us to become more comfortable speaking the language. I've always though that the most challenging part of learning a language is overcoming your fear of making mistakes and Andrew was able to help me do this. I also am really looking forward to continue studying spanish. The class has some great readings and the themes are really interesting. Furthermore, if you study everyday and do the assignments the exams will not very stressful. The key to this class is really studying everyday.","Great class to practice your speaking ability in section.","Great class and Martha is a great tf if you're really looking to get better at conversation.","Celeste is the best!","You will definitely enjoy this course, just be prepared for the level of spanish required!","It is a lot of work, but well worth it.  I feel like it definitely made me more competent and confident in my Spanish speaking and comprehension.","I took this class to satisfy my foreign language requirement and, surprisingly, I enjoyed it a lot. Most of this had to do with my TF (Andrew), who was awesome and a real treat to learn from. This class is more intense than AB, with readings just about every other night, four two page compositions throughout the semester, a 10 minute in-class oral presentation with a partner on a topic of your choice, and a heavy participation component of the grade. That being said, I found that if you gave reasonable effort it wasn't too difficult to get a good grade. Altogether, I was pleasantly surprised by this and recommend it to anyone needing to fulfill a foreign language requirement or with an interest in learning Spanish.","As someone who started in Aa, this course, although titled \"Repaso\", was boring in terms of content due to the repeat of grammar previously taught in other Spanish classes. I wish this class wasn't TOO \"Repaso\"; I felt myself being unmotivated to participate in class because I already knew the grammar structures. Andrew Gray is fantastic though, his feedback is great.","Great way to further knowledge of Spanish language and culture! It was a great way for me to ease back into the language after having learned two and a half years of high school Spanish, with a year without review in between then and this class. It's a pretty solid way to learn proper grammar and some interesting cultural and historical components of Latin America.","Section is pretty fun, especially because the class is small. Do the readings, as they're pretty short, and it's hard to have a fun discussion with people who didn't do the readings. Also, while the assignments are productive, they can feel a bit much at times.","Good course material, interesting readings, but deceivingly difficult, and sort of harsh grading","Great course! Get a David as a TF if you can.","This course is very good. I loved reading the short stories and poems and watching the movies. They were very interesting. Also, it was truly intermediate level. There was some prior knowledge required to really succeed, but it covered a lot of topics at a really good pace for students who should be in an intermediate language.","Get Andrew Gray as your TF! He's the best.","Take it with Celeste","This was a great class. The time commitment is very minimal for outside work, the teaching staff is great, and you learn and improve your Spanish skills so much. I really enjoyed Spanish C, and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to start Spanish again after high school or continue it from Spanish Aa and Ab.","If you have taken Spanish AB definitely take this course, it will be some review, but it will solidify the grammar and you will learn a lot more about Spanish and Latin American culture.","I thought this course gave a nice overview of Spanish grammar for intermediate-level language learners.  The readings were engaging and interesting in that they gave a small introduction to many famous figures and events in the Spanish-speaking world.  Many of the grammar review assignments were sort of the standard workbook fare, which was a bit boring and not, in my opinion, the most effective way to teach grammar, but my teacher Martha Diaz made class, even early in the morning, engaging, lively and fun.","Take this class! I learned so much more in this class than I had in Spanish Aa and Ab combined. Also, take this class with Se\u00c3\u00b1ora Diaz if possible; she is the best!","Very interactive, and overall a fun class to be a part of!","The grammar in this class is practically the same of that in Spanish Ab. It was just conducted entirely in Spanish, which has improved my spanish enormously.","Andrew Gray is the messiah of TF's. He takes every effort to help you with your language and makes a sometimes tedious process a lot of fun."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Maria is a FANTASTIC teacher. You will learn a lot in her class. The projects are fun and the readings are fascinating. Definitely take this course if you are interested in improving your Spanish!","This is a great review of the basics of the Spanish language and is helpful for those who feel that a review of Spanish would be helpful before going onto advanced level classes.","This is a great course for deepening Spanish skills and reviewing grammar, as well as learning about Latin American\/Spanish culture and picking up a lot of vocabulary.","The class does not have a lot of work, but in order to actually learn a language, it is necessary to put in the extra hours. And those extra hours will be worth it!","This class was awesome and a painless way to improve your grasp of the language. The class focuses primarily on grammar and writing, very little vocab and only a couple presentations. Senora Lujan is the best!","This is a fantastic way to extend your knowledge past high school Spanish. Maria makes class really enjoyable, and I appreciated how supportive she was.","This class really helps you to have a very firm and complete foundation before continuing on to higher levels of the language.","It's different from your high school Spanish classes","This is a typical Spanish course.","This class is a great way to improve your speaking and fulfill necessary graduation requirements.","don't take it if you have Luigi!","This is an amazing class, especially with Martha. Your spanish will improve.","It's fantastic! Luigi is a great teacher, and my Spanish writing and speaking improved significantly.","I found it difficult, but I don't think my skills were developed enough to take this course. Make sure you can have discussions easily in spanish because the entire course is conducted in Spanish.","This class is a lot of fun if you enjoy spanish! You learn a lot through some interesting exercises and stories. It's important to actually read the stories and review on your own time.","The TF makes your experience in this class. The workload is not bad at all and the stories that we read are sometimes challenging, but if you spend a little time on them, it's always manageable.","The environment's great, and you really learn Spanish well! You take out what you put in.","Be aware that you're expected to speak Spanish at all times","It is a good class to learn Spanish while in school because it makes us speak Spanish at least one hour every day.","This is a great class! The workload is not too difficult and the exams are fair.","This is a great class to get into language studies at Harvard.","This course is fun, challenging, and engaging.  If you want to become proficient in Spanish, this is a great intermediate-level course.  You will come out with an even greater enthusiasm and appreciation for the language.","This a great class and Martha is awesome!","The literature component of this class is quite challenging. Be aware of that. Also, grammar is taught very swiftly so be prepared to spend a lot of time out of class getting better at that if you're not rock solid.","I actually enjoyed this class more than I thought I would. I had three years of high school Spanish, a little informal experience from traveling, and then took a year off from Spanish and it was about the right level for me. I don't know if it was just my section, but there seemed to be a lot of people that were slightly over-qualified. As far as content, we covered various stories and poems from different Spanish-speaking countries and were actually exposed to some pretty serious issues. All the grammar is completely review. While we had a fair amount of discussion, I don't feel like my speaking skills improved very much. There's a reasonable amount of work that is spaced out well.  Martha is a great TF, very enthusiastic, and tries to make sure everyone is included in discussions. Overall, it's a solid language class, and an enjoyable break from the other kinds of classes at Harvard.","Course with an easy workload, but not difficult enough for students that desire to become fluent in Spanish.","Maria is the best TF ever! Definitely try to take the course with her. She is always available to you and makes sure that everyone is on the same page. The coursework is manageable but needs to be done nightly to ensure you don't fall behind. Overall, a great class because the more I spoke in class, the easier it was to speak Spanish outside the classroom.","The class was fun, laid back, and great for improving Spanish ability. They don't spend a lot of time actually teaching the grammar points in class, so it's helpful to be at the level where you can consider that to be mostly review (and\/or be disciplined about doing grammar drills on your own). The strength of this class lies in the opportunities that it gives you to use Spanish spontaneously in class discussion, so speak up as much as you can.","It's easy, just do the assignments.","This class is great for anyone interesting in furthering their grasp of Spanish grammar and for getting an overview of Spanish culture, through artists and authors, contemporary issues, like immigration and gang-related kidnappings, and essay writing. The articles we read, along with the movie and interviews we watched were all very helpful for understanding the language through discussion and reflection. The class is largely discussion based, especially regarding the analysis of readings, which is good for learning culture and language. Mar\u00c3\u00ada is a great teacher with a clear, accented voice so it makes it very easy to follow along. I recommend this course.","It was solid and fun.","This class was frustrating to me because it felt exactly like Spanish AB from the previous semester, minus the fun. You learn the exact same grammar you've learned a hundred times without improving your speaking skills at all. Also don't take 9am class everyday.","If you do decide to take it, commit to it. You get out what you put it"]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["I would recommend investing in private tutoring or conversation classes instead. Or enrolling in a more advanced class.","This is definitely a class you should consider taking, especially after Spanish Ab or 2-3 years of Spanish in high school. The grammar seems to be mostly review, so it assumes you know most of the tenses (present, preterit, imperfect, future, conditional, present and past perfect, present and imperfect subjunctive). The class does go over them, but doesn't spend a lot of time on them. There are a lot of readings and they can be fairly advanced at times, but the work is fun and interesting. Just be ready to really put forth the effort to do the readings and participate in class discussion. The tests are pretty easy, and they consist of both grammar and short essays (usually 2) on the most recent readings (comparison of two readings, response to a reading, analysis of a poem, etc.)","Best class ever! Shop the TFs and make sure you pick one that fits your learning style. Martha Lujan is the best","The difficulty of this course definitely depends on how comfortable you are with speaking and understanding spanish. If you thought Ab was a breeze then this course should be just fine for you. Make sure you study the grammar and read the stories before coming to class each day so you are able to participate in the class discussions.","Andrew is great!","Helps significantly with listening comprehension.  Most students probably won't become fluent in Spanish by course end, but should improve fairly significantly, depending on how much time they put into it.","The course was very fun and my spanish improved a great deal.","Try to take it with Maria!!","Great spanish class and is pretty rigorous","This class is much more advanced than Spanish AB. Make sure that your Spanish is up to par (No English at all).","This class is easy, but dull, unless you are truly interested in learning Spanish.  Martha's section requires a LOT of speaking and participation.","Great course to improve spanish skills, not a lot of work!","Only recommend if they actually enjoy Spanish","I would recommend failing the placement exam so that they allow you to take Aa and Ab to fulfill the language requirement.  Spanish C is significantly more difficult than Ab.","If you like small class sizes and day-to-day assignments and have a decent background in Spanish, this course would be the right fit for you.","It is very easy to slack off and not do the required readings (among other things). This will not put you in position to get an A.  Set aside time to actually work on and study Spanish.","It requires consistent effort as it meets four days a week, but it never gets overwhelmingly difficult.","Spanish C is your typical Spanish class that's the highest level of basic Spanish you can take, but it doesn't actually have a number so you're still learning the language as opposed to delving deep into a subject and interacting more with the culture. Andrew Gray is a great TF though, so try to get him. He's not a native speaker - so you might want to look elsewhere if you're trying to perfect your Mexicana accento - but he's a great teacher and very dedicated.","This class has wonderful reading material that is challenging but achievable, and very interesting. The discussions in class were always engaging and fun, even at 9 in the morning. I feel much more comfortable with conversational Spanish than I did at the beginning of the semester.","its fun!","Andrew is the best Spanish teacher I have ever had. He is patient, accessible, willing to go out of his way to help, extremely knowledgeable of all the grammatical aspects of Spanish (and many other languages), extremely easy to understand, very encouraging, and just an all around pleasure to be around. I hope he is around for you next year because this course would have been much less enjoyable without him.","Pretty straightforward- endless stories and poems to increase your comfort with reading, writing, and speaking Spanish. No new material, and in fact, we reviewed concepts in about the same order as they were taught in Ab. Not that hard but also not that interesting; we didn't learn any new material and the endless stories about the same themes of colonialism got my on my nerves by the end.","This class was pretty easy, and a great way to improve Spanish skills, while also knocking out the language requirement.","The pace of the course and emphasis on in-class participation, reading comprehension, speaking, and writing make it a demanding class for intermediate\/ advanced beginner students of Spanish, but these things also make the class very rewarding. I definitely feel that my speaking abilities have improved, as have my writing and reading skills. I love the class's focus on the history and culture of Latin America and South America; this was very informative and introduced me to new perspectives on historical events that had not been covered in other classes I have taken. Overall, this is an excellent class.","This class isn't that bad if you have the right TF. The grading can be arbitrary at times especially with the quizzes. Makes sure to work with Andrew Gray! He'll be a big help.","There's a lot of busy work.","Fairly stress free and you learn a decent amount","It's a very enjoyable class with a good class environment of discussion. The written assignments take some time, but other than that, the class is well-tailored to facilitate people from many different levels of Spanish ability.","Make sure that you have a good understanding of Spanish grammar and a good Spanish vocabulary. If you have those things, the readings and discussions will be enjoyable and interesting.","If you want to learn Spanish and place into this course, take it. This course is not a joke, but it is very fair. It doesn't require too much work, and the more you put into it, the more you'll get out of it.","I took it for language requirement and was mostly just working on getting through it the entire year. BUT, I'm writing this recommendation to advise everyone to get Andrew Gray. I was dreading another semester of Spanish but he managed to make it fun and engaging and more-than-bearable. (And it was a 9am section even!)","I am a law student, so the only reservations I would have about recommending this class to others is that there is daily homework and an attendance grade. Law students, who may have court appearances and client meetings etc, may be penalized for being unable to make it to class four days a week.","It's a great class! Very similar to Spanish Ab, with pretty straightforward work and a consistent workload. The readings (poems and some short stories) are actually really fun and you get to do a bit more than just the grammar and vocabulary kind of stuff.","It is fun.","Immersive and well-structured class. While it might take you out of your comfort zone as far as reading, writing, and speaking Spanish are concerned, you are given the tools to handle it and learn from it.","This course really works to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of Spanish grammar and an interesting introduction to Spanish literature as well. I truly enjoyed the emersion into the language that this course provided. Maria Ramirez-Lopez is an amazing TF, who goes above and beyond to help her students.","It was not super time consuming, but I learned a lot because of all of the participation and readings we had to do.","This class is a good option for anyone who has taken AB Spanish or at least 2 years of high school Spanish. The time commitment is fairly low, and the tests and essays are fair. This class will allow you to improve both your speaking and writing skills!","It's often easy to slide by in language classes, but if you actually read the stories and work hard to participate in class, you'll get a lot more out of this class.","This class is much more fun than AB, it focuses on stories and music rather than just pure grammar. Maria is an awesome TF.","I did not feel like my Spanish was good enough to really get the most out of this course i could. It was super unorganized and the website didn't help at all. If you like Spanish, you'll probably like this class. If you don't, it will be an unpleasant experience.","Take it with Andrew, amazing!","Martha was an amazing teacher. She's entertaining, funny, but also a great teacher. She creates a fun and supportive learning environment, allowing everyone the chance to practice speaking.","You need to stay on top of the work in this class. None of it is particularly difficult and the teachers are willing to work with you, but it's very easy to neglect the class and do badly.","This is a great course. If you are looking to improve beyond AP Spanish this is the perfect transition. The small sections mean you get a lot of practice speaking. The assignments are fair and overall the course is low stress and minimal work.","It has a great teacher who challenges you to learn."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["Great class. Not that much different from Spanish AB, even more laid back I would argue","If you are interested in looking at Latin American literature or just want a class that focus on the practice of writing, reading comprehension and speaking in Spanish you should definitely take this class.","Alina is the best tf and it is very well structured. You will learn Spanish if you put the time in.","Take this class! It improves your Spanish greatly and the readings are amazing! If you can get Jonathan as your TF try to.","This is a really great class, but definitely get Martha as your preceptor! She's absolutely incredible and is super sweet. Even though Spanish is an annoying requirement I actually enjoyed being in class and doing the assignments.","I felt like I got worse at Spanish while taking this class, since I took ACD in the fall and got pretty good fairly quickly and then just sort of languished in Spanish C. It was an okay class, and sometimes you'll just have to take it in order to move up a level in Spanish; but if you can just go to Spanish 30 I would do that (although I'm not sure if that's any better). Some of the cultural stuff we learned about was pretty cool, but I think I could've gotten that in a history or gov class without going through the tedious grammar part.","Go to office hours!!","Spanish C is a wonderfully taught class. If you get Mar\u00c3\u00ada Ramirez you're even luckier because she makes an everyday class enjoyable. It is a great place to either come into after a few years of Spanish in high school or right after Spanish Aa\/Ab. The course content is fascinating and does a real good job at presenting primary sources so you learn language and culture all at once.","As a student at HDS, I appreciated this course for its focus on building living language skills, as opposed to the emphasis on reading and translating at the Div School. I recommend the language courses on the yard to HDS students who want to speak Spanish professionally, and wish I had taken all three of my required courses in the Romance Languages Department. Thank you!","Spanish C is like Spanish AB with less tests, but more reading and writing. The fact that it is entirely in Spanish is scary at first, but it improves your mastery of the language dramatically.","I always disliked language in high school because it felt tedious, difficult, and boring, but I have loved my time in the Spanish program at Harvard this year. I think a lot of this has to do with Profe Dorfman (who is awesome and unfortunately returning to Argentina after this year), but also because of the structure of the class. Rather than doing a bunch of worksheets and busy-work, we read authentic articles from Hispanic countries about the culture of those regions, and discussed larger societal issues in Spanish. It felt like, instead of just learning Spanish to learn Spanish, we were learning how to use the language of Spanish as a tool to communicate about broader, more important issues.","The class is interesting and, if you apply yourself, the improvements in reading, writing, and speaking are noticeable.","Good solid class for language requirements. Not all too taxing outside of class, but requires work and attention in class to do well.","I do not recommend this course if you want to learn to speak Spanish. Studying on your own or hiring a private tutor would be a better investment.","Fun and good for your language skills.","If you have substantial experience in Spanish, take this class. If you were like me and took a break from Spanish classes in high school before coming to college, take Spanish AB first. While I believe my writing improved dramatically, my speaking in Spanish didn't really improve, and that was the aspect that I really wanted to strengthen. Also, the class is graded a lot more harshly than Spanish AB (like you can't re-write the essays on the exams, and it's unclear on how to actually do better on the essay portion of the exam). You're going to have to put in much more work into this class than Spanish AB.","Spanish is largely dependent on the TF you get, and Jonathan was amazing.","I only took this to fulfill the language requirement and hated Spanish AB first semester. I think this was better just because Martha is super nice, energetic, and she makes class a lot of fun. Make sure you are pretty solid in your Spanish because the entire thing is in Spanish and you read a lot of long articles\/stories that are entirely in Spanish, no English.","You don't always get a chance to take a class in a small environment like this. This course can be a lot of fun, especially if you have a good group of classmates. You spend a lot of time talking to them.","Do the homework","Daniela was the best, unfortunately she is returning to Argentina. However, I hear the other professors are great as well.","Section leaders can vary, so try to find a section with a good teacher. Would advise that students have a solid background in writing in Spanish.","Get Natalie as your TF!! Young, fun, and fashionable. She leads class very well, includes everyone, will help you out if you ever forget a word, is super funny and understanding! You cannot get a better TF and having her as your TF for section will make the experience so much better!","If you like spanish you will like this class. If you are just doing it to fulfill your foreign language requirement you probably won't enjoy it.","If you understand Spanish generally, you should take it.","Hard as hell and unless you have to avoid the class","This class is fun and engaging and allows you to explore various Latin American cultures while also honing your Spanish speaking skills.","It is tougher than your average Spanish course because all of the grades are test, essay, and presentation based so you have to know your stuff. The course lacks structure in its practice layout, but the topics are interesting.","If you put the effort into it it is so rewarding","I don't like learning other languages but I recommend taking Spanish C because it's fun to learn subjunctive.","The subject matter is very interesting and Jonathan was a fantastic TF.","Very manageable workload (likely less work than Ab), fun classes and interesting material","This course is a good intermediate Spanish course and an enjoyable class even if you don't really want to be taking a language class but have to for the requirement.","It is a good course for improving your proficiency in all things Spanish.","Get a good TF i had a bad one with a bad accent and was not the best teacher. Shop around to find a good TF and it will save you.","This is a great class. I think you should have a basic knowledge of Spanish before you enter, but you will definitely improve while here.","If you want to improve your abilities to speak and write in Spanish, this is a great course to take. You learn a great deal about different cultures in this course as well.","The class is discussion-based, which I believe helped improve my Spanish. It's also a lot of reading, which is also helpful for improving Spanish. It's a smaller group of students, and I got very close to my classmates. I would definitely recommend it.","This course creates a fostering environment for learning a language. There is a good balance between examinations and compositional writings, grammar and reading comprehension.","Try to take it with the Teaching Fellow I had; she is excellent.","Make sure that this is the right level for you. I think that Spanish 30 would have been a better fit for me, but I realized that too late.","If you want to learn grammar in a parrot fashion take this course. If you would like to learn how to speak Spanish, don't.","There is a LOT of reading. Also it is unclear what the actual homework assignment are each night. Also there is a ton of printing that you have to do."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["This class will push you, but you will adjust quickly! don't be intimidated by the fact that the course is taught in Spanish. I learned more Spanish in one semester than I did in 4 years of high school Spanish.","Push yourself to speak as much as you can in Spanish. Practice makes perfect!","Awesome class to really help you move further in learning the language.","This is a great course if you end up with Martha.","This is a good class, and Sr. Rios is a really good and nice teacher. It's not too time consuming, but it's definitely more work than spanish 11.","Go to Rafael's office hours! He always takes time for individual feedback, which is great.","Spanish is by far the most useful language you can learn in America, so if you want to actually get something out of your foreign language requirement strongly consider Spanish. It may not be the most fun or interesting all of the time, but all of the TAs genuinely care about you learning the language and will do their best to see you succeed. Since the class is taught in small sections you will be forced to talk whether you like it or not and this leads to an infinitely better experience learning the language than in high school language classes. Overall, not a ton of work outside of class, but still challenging at times.","it truly helps your knowledge of spanish specifically in reading and writing","This course is a great intermediate Spanish course. You are only permitted to speak in Spanish, and we always had lively conversations. The stories we read in the class are very interesting, and we receive a lot of practice with grammar and writing skills as well.","Emilio is such a great teacher and very undertaking be sure to make the most of his knowledge and incredible passion.","great class","Spanish 20 is a fun way to learn spanish and learn more about the cultures of the spanish speaking world.","I took this course after having taken Spanish 15 (accelerated). I found it to be a great review of what I learned and despite the fact that it barely covers new content, you will quickly realize how much Spanish you forgot from the previous semester. Antonio is a fantastic section leader who is enthusiastic and makes the course more enjoyable. The only thing that I didn't enjoy about the class was the larger class size. Having come from Spanish 15 I was used to a class of 10 where participation was necessary from every student. Spanish 15 was also more interactive and had activities that required us to partner up often whether it was to work on a worksheet or play a game. This course had about 15-18 students and so it meant that there was far less participation expected and the more fun aspects of Spanish 15 were taken out.","I learned a lot about the Spanish language, and before this class I had not really enjoyed learning Spanish. However, I enjoyed this class.","Very effective review of beginning Spanish to continue your language learning","have Martha as your professor! she is the sweetest and really great at getting you to learn spanish. she talks in spanish the entire class and ensures students do the same, great environment","Depends on your TF, but I had a great time in the course and learned a lot. Viviane is very engaging and enthusiastic, and makes you excited to learn spanish.","It's a great way to enhance and practice your Spanish","If you take Spanish 20 try your hardest to be in Senor Martha's class! She's the absolute sweetest and very understanding.","This class is much less structured than Spanish 11. The literature is interesting and the exams aren't too difficult.","Spanish 20 is a good first step. You get a refresher of a very condensed Spanish grammar unit while also getting to practice your speaking skills.","A fun class, but meeting everyday becomes hard","I have absolutely no bad things to say about this class.  Martha is the section leader that you want.  She speaks in only Spanish, but that really ends up helping you so much.  The assignments are fine, the class is really just awesome.  YOURE GOING TO GET SO MUCH BETTER AT SPANISH BY TAKING THIS CLASS.","Martha is quite possibly the most amazing instructor ever and made the class an extremely enjoyable experience","Shop multiple sections if you can to get a sense of the different TFs teaching. In my experience, a good TF can make or break your experience so it's definitely worth it to take a little extra time up front to make your semester much more enjoyable.","This is a great class! It's not the easiest, but it's better than the basic spanish classes because the topic is more interesting.","This course was a great way to improve spanish speaking and writing skills! It moves pretty quickly, but the readings are very interesting, and the small classroom setting promotes great discussions and a fun learning environment!","Only would recommend if someone needed to get a requirement out of the way or was interesting in learning Spanish.","I had Viviane as my TF and she was really great. I think a lot of the experience in this class is dependent on the TF. However, there is a lot of busy work and I found myself doing more work than I expected. With that being said, I never really stressed about this class and enjoyed going to class.","This class is a solid Spanish class, though not too different from your average high school class.","You should take this class if you want to better your spanish, but be prepared that you have to teach yourself all of the grammar pieces.","not too difficult","This course is very good for completing the language requirement because it is completely in Spanish so you learn a lot, the course load is not too heavy, and Martha is an excellent teacher who has a lot of enthusiasm and excitement.","The TF that you get is extremely important in how difficult and\/or enjoyable the class is.","You have the opportunity to practice speaking the language and listening to those that speak it.  Also, the grammar that you learn is reinforced by the various readings.  Overall, it is a great Spanish course.","Take your time with analysis of the articles, make sure you clearly understand them before class.","This is really an interactive class, but much of the practice \/ content needs to be done on your own because the TF goes through the powerpoint really fast; much of the learning happens through classwork."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"3.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"78","response rate":"75.64","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SPANSH C","course_id":"4477","cat_num":"125011","1s":"1","2s":"6","3s":"15","4s":"33","5s":"33"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SPANSH C","course_id":"4477","cat_num":"5819","1s":"4","2s":"19","3s":"33","4s":"10","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SPANSH C","course_id":"4477","cat_num":"125011","1s":"10","2s":"59","3s":"11","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
