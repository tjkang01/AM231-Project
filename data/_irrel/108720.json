It was interesting relaxed, but I think I learned a lot.","If you have some economics coursework, it would be desirable.  I struggled a little not having this.  It is otherwise a fantastic seminar.","This was a great discussion seminar to further explore many of the topics touched upon in ESPP 78 and EC 1661.  There are few assignments, but you should do the reading so you understand the topics.  There is a lot of flexibility with the seminar discussions, so its a good seminar for students interested in environmental regulations and the impacts that want to further explore the fundamentals and applications."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.83","workload":"2.17","difficulty":"3.33","recommendation":"3.83","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ESPP 90v","course_id":"1577","cat_num":"74118","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ESPP 90v","course_id":"1577","cat_num":"74118","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ESPP 90v","course_id":"1577","cat_num":"74118","1s":"2","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
