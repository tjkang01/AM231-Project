Kiran is an expert on development economics, so pick this section if that is the category your thesis falls in.","This is a great course to take while writing a thesis. It really helps you remain on top of things. Kiran is a terrific course leader to have.","Kiran is awesome. Definitely worth taking the thesis class with her -- even if your thesis topic has nothing to do with developmental economics (mine doesn't). Overall, the thesis class is great in keeping you on target to make progress is you use it wisely.","Have data before you form a question - DATA DATA DATA is important!","Not particularly time-consuming but be sure to stay on track throughout the semester. It's easy to let a few weeks get away from you and fall behind.","Kiran is absolutely fantastic. She is extremely helpful in guiding thesis writers through the process and always knows where to point you in terms of all kinds of different help. Even if your thesis topic does not go exactly with the \"Development\" title, Kiran always offers very insightful feedback. I chose this workshop because in my few brief encounters with her when submitting my study card, she was already very helpful.","Kiran is amazing, gives such good feedback and is so supportive!!","As always, thesis takes a lot of time and effort."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["The instructor makes such a difference for this course. Kiran is amazing!","Kiran was the BEST seminar leader I could have wished for!","SIGN UP FOR KIRAN'S CLASS. It doesn't matter if your topic is development economics (mine wasn't). Sign up to be in her section of the class. Kiran is absolutely amazing. So helpful both when talking about your thesis or talking about life. Don't miss the opportunity to work with her.","This is a great course. Thesis-writing is a tough process, but 985 makes it bearable and even enjoyable at times. Kiran is the greatest 985 leader to have. Get her."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Kiran is great! Having been in her seminar, I obviously didn't experience any of the others, but if you want to play it safe, try to be in her section if you can. Also, beware of Stata p-sets. They take longer that you'd think and in the end they won't count for anything, but you have to budget some time for them.","Be passionate about what you write your thesis on","If you want to write a thesis you have to take this class. It is totally worth it though!","Kiran is a joy to work with. You'd be lucky to be in her seminar.","Definitely take the seminar with Kiran if you can.  She is incredibly supportive and helpful."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Get into Kiran's section!","If you're writing an Econ or AM-Ec thesis, take this class. You will be very lucky to have Kiran advise you throughout the process.","If you can take your thesis seminar with Kiran, definitely do it!  She was really nice and encouraging about everything.  I would also recommend that AM-Ec students take it as well, since it is really helpful for getting advice and being forced to keep up.","Kiran is amazing!!! She is so thoughtful in all of her edits and comments.  If you write a thesis, she will be a huge determinant of how focused you will be throughout the thesis writing process.","Be ready to put in some work, but if you are on top of it is very manageable."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Writing a thesis is going to be one of the most rewarded things you have ever done academically.","Make sure to plan your thesis work well ahead of time!","Kiran's thesis seminar on Development and Health Economics is an absolutely wonderful seminar! If you're thinking about writing a thesis, I highly encourage taking Kiran's class. She gives such individualized feedback, making time during her busy schedule to read your drafts entirely and provide huge amounts of helpful advice. You meet with her every week, and throughout the semester you also hear about other peers' theses in small discussion seminars. Kiran is also extremely knowledgeable about topics in development economics and can give helpful direction when it comes to econometric issues. She is extremely friendly and approachable! Moreover, the seminar meetings are extremely participatory and conversation-based, which fosters an environment of \"learning from each other\" in class. Finally, the STATA mini-course provides very helpful foundations for your thesis, though I wish a little bit more guidance and direction were given (particularly when it came to STATA codes).","Kiran is awesome.  She is incredibly helpful and willing to answer your stupid questions along with your good questions.","You should really be dedicated to your topic- don't just do it to do it or you will regret it.","Go with a concentration advisor when you're choosing a 985 seminar"]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Kiran is a wonderful section leader for 985 - you truly feel supported throughout the thesis process, and she gives detailed and helpful feedback. If you take 985, all of the section leaders are wonderful, but Kiran is just awesome.","Perfectly designed course \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it gives you the guidance you need to work on your thesis, with econometrics reviews, library resource guides, and tips for writing and formatting peppered in. I did not feel like any of the assignments were unnecessary \u00e2\u20ac\u201d over the course of the semester, we basically wrote the background\/introduction, methodology, and preliminary analysis\/results for our theses. We also collected the data we needed. Kiran is AWESOME and gives excellent feedback.","985 sections and meetings with one's 985 instructor make the thesis process manageable and fun!","Kiran is so nice and helpful throughout the entire thesis process, as well as gives very detailed feedback. She also keeps you on track and is willing to sit and talk about any issues you are going through.","Kiran is the best. She makes the thesis endeavor incredibly smooth. Her enthusiasm is invigorating, and I am so thankful to have her as a mentor in this process.","Really worth taking, even for Applied Math-Econ as a commitment device. Kiran is really helpful.","\"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you\" - taking this course will make you realize how helpful economics department at Harvard actually is."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"8.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"12","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 985LA","course_id":"947","cat_num":"109235","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 985l","course_id":"947","cat_num":"94962","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 985LA","course_id":"947","cat_num":"109235","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
