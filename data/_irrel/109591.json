This is a fair class with a very reasonable work load. Students should definitely do the reading since the professors cold call students to discuss the figures in the paper.","I came into the class not knowing what to expect, but now I've grown fascinated by glia. I'd recommend this class","There is such little known about glia that I found this crash course in glial cells very exciting--in terms of research, every month there seems to be an exciting development. Kristian and Dorothy worked really well as a team and provided very well-informed commentary on the papers we discussed.","Good course, not much weekly work required which is actually helpful in allowing you to take the time to understand the papers.  Class goes by pretty quick too because everybody gets involved with the discussion of the weekly paper."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["The teachers are so wonderful and knowledgeable.  The material and subject matter was also really interesting, and had a great connection to clinical aspects.","Great class: nice professors, light workload, small class allowing discussion, and interesting material on a topic that is often glossed over in biology.","Great class. Be sure to read the articles, otherwise you will be wasting your time","Learning about such a ground-breaking field is really rewarding!","great way to fulfill an upper-level neuro requirement! glial cells are the future of well, just about everything... learn about their importance before they become a \"household\" cell implicated in everything from development, immune system, neuropsychiatric diseases, and traumatic injuries in the central nervous system"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"2.90","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"10","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hfh","course_id":"11068","cat_num":"87994","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hfh","course_id":"11068","cat_num":"87994","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hfh","course_id":"11068","cat_num":"87994","1s":"2","2s":"6","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
