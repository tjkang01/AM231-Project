The emphasis on methodological issues was very valuable."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["If you are interested in a pervasive and highly significant element in the construction and nature of the Hebrew Bible, this class is essential. It will provide a clear treatment of the phenomenon of Inner-Biblical exegesis, in a way that allows you to discover it for yourself in new ways, week after week.","This course will reveal connections in the Biblical text which will likely change the way you approach the Hebrew Bible for the rest of your life. You will leave feeling like you can't read any Biblical narrative in isolation, and the shape of inner-Biblical allusion you start to outline is so fascinating you won't be able to stop trying to trace it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"8.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HEBREW 130","course_id":"3790","cat_num":"126069","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HEBREW 130","course_id":"3790","cat_num":"53182","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HEBREW 130","course_id":"3790","cat_num":"126069","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
