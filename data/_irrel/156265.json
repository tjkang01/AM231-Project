Meredith is a wonderful and enthusiastic instructor, the readings are really eye-opening, and cover a subject that is so important to think about but not really covered at Harvard.  The research project is a good opportunity to pick something you're interested in and work on it for the whole semester--you are given pretty much free reign over what you want to write about so that's nice."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"40.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 60h","course_id":"12420","cat_num":"82983","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 60h","course_id":"12420","cat_num":"82983","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
