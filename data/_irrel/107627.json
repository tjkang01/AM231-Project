Aminova.","Great language class!","Gulnora is very easy-going and friendly, but very committed to teaching. This class is a rewarding experience if you're also really committed to learning. If you don't take the class seriously, however, you'll probably be pretty uncomfortable.","Excellent course with a great instructor. Be prepared for a large time commitment.","Take the opportunity to learn Uzbek with a wonderful Uzbek teacher passionate about her job","Gulnora is a truly gifted instructor who brings tremendous enthusiasm to the often arduous process of language learning. Beyond her thorough teachings of the nuts and bolts of the language, she offers remarkable insight into the history and culture of Central Asia, the region's complex linguistic landscape, and inspires her students to make language learning a part of everyday life outside the classroom. Her passion is visible every day in class, and I felt like I was consistently making progress with each subsequent class."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["It is a true shame that this year will be the last opportunity for students at Harvard to study with Gulnora Aminova. Her passion and enthusiasm for teaching the language and sharing her deep insights the history and culture of Central Asia were always inspiring. The experience has opened up new directions in my research, and has marked the beginning of what I hope will be a long-term engagement with Central Asia.","Learning Uzbek is a lot of hard work. Because there are few cognates, it's very difficult to wrap one's head around the vocabulary. The grammar is strange at first, but actually very logical, and you'll start to get a feel for it by the end of the year. The progress you'll make over the course of the year is very rewarding."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"2.60","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"TURKISH 121","course_id":"3891","cat_num":"14198","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"TURKISH 121","course_id":"3891","cat_num":"14198","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"TURKISH 121","course_id":"3891","cat_num":"14198","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
