Absolutely horrible. While I can see Rajiv being a good teacher in other contexts, in this particular context he was not a good fit. Rajiv seemed well intentioned and I suspect he was trying to scare us into studying for the course and hopefully when we check our final grades we will all do fine, but this course was a spectacular failure. It seemed virtually impossible for most of us to do well and was highly stressful and an overall bad experience.","Get through it!! It's not impossible","This class takes >14 hours a week, do NOT try take other demanding classes with it. Learn from the beginning not to get invested in the class, Rajiv will never be satisfied with your work. I noticed those students who got tutors did a lot better (as they got help with the pests) judge for yourself if you are okay with this.
