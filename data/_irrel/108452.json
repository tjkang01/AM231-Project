Kaushik is extremely personable and helpful, and he makes a very open and relaxing atmosphere in the class. You will start to enjoy being in class, especially as you develop your bonds with your classmates and instructor. The class discussions are interesting, and you really learn how to dissect papers well. I am very glad I chose this course, and I am looking forward to the next semester!","The professor is extremely knowledgeable and supportive. The discussions were a great part of the course and the topics were very interesting. Most classes do not touch on working memory or discuss it in such depth. The course does a great job of teaching students to read with a critical lens and question results, avoiding the tendency to accept statements as fact simply because of the journal in which a study was published. If you're interested in neurobiology research, this is a great course to take.","It's fine. Working memory probably won't get you all riled up the way sex and aggression classes might, but it's still interesting. I just wish there were more feedback.","The material covered in the course is always very interesting and the papers are fascinating.  I learned a lot about looking at papers with a more critical eye and am looking forward to another semester of the class.","Kaushik is a fantastic teacher. He is very approachable, friendly, and helpful!"]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This is one of the better neurobio tutorials. Kaushik is awesome to talk to and knows a lot about different topics in the field. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also very low stress.","You basically read one article a week, and someone presents on it. The more in-detail you read the articles before class, the more you get out of it. Try to come prepared with some questions. The class can be a little slow at times but you do learn interesting techniques in neurobiology.","Definitely a strong contender for the best Neuro tutorial!","This is a great tutorial. You should definitely take one if you are a neurobiology concentrator, because it is a lower work load than most other classes. That being said, some of the papers in the class can be difficult to understand, so make sure you have enough time to devote to reading the papers before class. Additionally, be sure to ask for clarity on the assignment questions if you are confused about them.","This is a great introduction to the independent thinking and questioning that anyone involved with research will have to do on a daily basis!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Really rewarding use of time!","This is an awesome class that is a testament to how well the neurobio seminars are run. Kaushik is an incredible, personable professor that I greatly appreciated working with for an entire year. The workload was modest and I can definitely say I learned to read papers better, critically analyze the science behind them, and discuss my thoughts with other students more effectively.","Take this tutorial! Most of the tutorials offered are fantastic, so you should definitely take one as a neurobiology concentrator. I recommend this one because it is a topic that may not be covered much, but has huge implications for other areas of neurobiology research. The methods used for studying working memory are very applicable to neuroscientific research in general, so reading these papers will help you in understanding other neurobio courses in the future. There are only 4 assignments throughout the year in addition to short weekly summaries, so it is not a heavy workload at all. The small class size is great at facilitating discussion. The second semester also has higher expectations, but the same amount of work and more engaging papers, so the course becomes extremely enjoyable and academically enriching by the time it reaches completion. Kaushik is great! This class will definitely teach you how to critically analyze primary papers."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"8","response rate":"62.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hfe","course_id":"3915","cat_num":"15731","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hfe","course_id":"3915","cat_num":"15731","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hfe","course_id":"3915","cat_num":"15731","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
