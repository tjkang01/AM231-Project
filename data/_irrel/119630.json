Osnat and Irit are amazing!","Not too much work, and very worthwhile; establish a great bond between classmates and instructor - perfect for language practice.","Great teachers who are fun and accessible.","It's more than one step above Heb 120, there's a lot more expected of you. But it's a great class, Irit & Osnat are awesome, and Hebrew at Harvard is an excellent program."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Osnat is a phenomenal instructor who is passionate about teaching Hebrew. She takes all steps necessary to help students understand the material and improve in their writing and speaking skills. She has produced a wealth of online materials to assist in the learning process.","The course had fewer enrollees than modern hebrew 120ab so there was much more time for oral discussion and presentations. I really liked the integration of language skills with Israeli geography, culture, and politics. The teaching is outstanding. This class, and the Hebrew Program at large, will be the most fun and engaging of your College career. Do yourself a favor and see what Hebrew at Harvard is like.","Great way to learn Hebrew."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Modern Hebrew is a fantastic course and anyone who takes it will not be sorry they did! It is a course in which you learn a great deal, have a good time, and get to be part of a really special community of students which Osnat fosters. She really cares and takes interest in every student's growth. Take this class!!","That it is a very nice class with a nice atmosphere!","Great way to continue studying Hebrew; Osnat is so helpful, always accessible outside of class, and eager to help with anything-from grammar, to essay writing, to conversation in Hebrew","If you want know some Hebrew and want more advanced study, this is a great course."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["The Hebrew Department at Harvard is unparalleled. The small nature of the department allows for so much individual attention, so that the teachers become mentors and you develop real relationships with your classmates as well. My hebrew drastically improved over the semester, and 130a is definitely a substantial step up from 120. Yet, I could not be more happy that I took the class.","Tours of Israel, Israeli songs and literature, and minimal grammar. The course material was enjoyable. The final project was not hard, but quite tedious.","It is fun and not too stressful. There are long writing assignments but not too many and the actual content isn't too difficult.","Osnat is a wonderful teacher. She is patient and focuses on helping you to improve from wherever you're at. (So you don't need to worry if you feel behind the other students at the beginning of the semester.)","I would definitely recommend this class. It's fun, not too challenging, and you learn a lot. It's easy not to put your most into it, though, and that will leave you learning less than you would like, since it's very much a class in which you get out what you put in.","Great class, one of the best I've taken at Harvard. Osnat is really nice and extremely helpful.  She's always happy to help with questions outside of class, and also very flexible with due dates and etc.  I learned a lot and my Hebrew really improved as well."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"10","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MOD-HEB 130a","course_id":"3838","cat_num":"4985","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MOD-HEB 130a","course_id":"3838","cat_num":"4985","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MOD-HEB 130a","course_id":"3838","cat_num":"4985","1s":"2","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
