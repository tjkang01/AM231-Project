If he teaches it again, definitely take it!","Great, engaging material and very relevant stuff.","This course is well-organized and covers very interesting material.  Alex did a great job putting together the readings and class discussions.","This is a great seminar to take to learn a good deal about business power in American public policy. Alex is a great preceptor and is very invested in this course; he was also very approachable and helpful with all assignments.
