Granted the structure of the course is pretty much non-existent, the project you get to work on is unique and meaningful to a tribal nation or group that affiliates with one. It gives a nice intro to Indian Country and the work that can be done for those that have no experience with tribes. It is also incredibly motivating for those who have experience in Indian Country or have a connection in some way.","it's a great class that provides you with real world experience. You will work on projects that will actually be applied and will actually help communities.","It's unlike other courses at Harvard where you are very involved in the whole research and work process and get experiential learning where you get to work together with a Native American reservation on a self-selected project! It is a little unorganized and self-run so you must be able to set personal deadlines and be motivated to complete a good project without the push of a grade."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"5.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"10","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EMR 121","course_id":"13576","cat_num":"160752","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"EMR 121","course_id":"13576","cat_num":"160752","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
