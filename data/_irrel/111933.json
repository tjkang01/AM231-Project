'07":{"comments":["The reading skills learned in this class seemed virtually indispensible to my research already halfway through the semester.","This is a good course for those seeking a basic skill in reading French.","Lots of work - as much as a grad seminar if you let it. But very comprehensive preparation and helpful instructor.","Get the book and do it on your own. You will get more out of it. The classroom setting is not necessary for this kind of course.","At all costs, avoid this course so long as Gayle teaches it. In future, when offered as attached to another professor, consider taking it if you love language as a thing, but not if you're especially concerned with learning any single one.","If you have M. Gayle as your instructor, take it!","French Ax can be challenging, especially without prior experience with the language, but the course is enjoyable and very effective. I went from total uncomprehension to reading with confidence.","Work hard, and it'll be extremely rewarding. Don't work hard, and be miserable (probably). It's just no fun doing languages unless you really put the effort in to understand what is going on. But this course is an incredibly efficient way to acquire decent reading ability in French. It is quite remarkable how much ground is covered. I am delighted to have been able to learn French in this way, after having wanted to improve my rather poor middle-school level French for years."]},"Spring '08":{"comments":["You will be able to read French at the end of this course.","Provided one puts the effort forward, one will succeed in and enjoy this course.","DO NOT take this as a 5th class--there is a ton of translation work which is very time consuming. as a 4th class it was totally reasonable, but i think it would be far too much work for someone with a full course-load.","I struggled a lot in this course.  Throughout the entire semester I felt that I could never catch up.  But while I was reviewing for the final, I was surprised to see how much I've learned.  I was able to translate many passages without a dictionary, passages that I've struggled with a few months ago.  I definitely recommend this course.  Just remember that you may not see instant results, but if you keep working on all the assignments, you'll be amazed in the end how much you've learned.","You will learn French grammar thoroughly, but you will not learn to speak or understand French - this is consistent with the course description.","don't take it if you want to learn how to speak french!"]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["A unique and interesting learning experience provided by the perks and ingenious 'mantras' of the teacher.","Keep up with the syllabus, particularly if one is without any background in French.

Very effective.","Not very exciting, but you will probably learn enough french to pass a written exam.","It is a very hard course (almost an indigestion of French) but the professor is really great (helpful in correcting and thorough in her explanations) and at the end of just one semester one can get to the point of actually reading French. Very useful course if you have little time and great need to learn French for your research.","This course is perfect for anyone who wants to learn to read French -- if you put in effort to do the work, it pays off very well.","I can read French now (for the most part)","It's a useful class, but I wouldn't take it as a \"fun\" elective, or just to learn general French.  It serves its purpose well, but many students might rather take French A.","learn the vocab!"]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["I would make sure they know the nature of an x-for-reading course. They should not expect to produce (or even pronounce) French. They should also be aware that the result of this kind of course is mostly dependent on their own working through the book.","Fast-paced course and highly cumulative.","it's going to take you more time to do the work than you think, and if you fall behind or slack off, it is very hard to get caught up.  This is especially true if you have no foreign language background","If you complete the assignments and attend the classes, they will prepare you to read French moderately well while relying on a dictionary for less familiar words.","If you want to take a language qualifying exam, this course would be the right one to take.","If you take this course, be ready to go really, really fast.","I would recommend taking the course with a different instructor.","Students with an understanding of how languages work generally will have no difficulty, and will be able to read French by the end of the course. Students who struggle with language courses generally will have a great deal of trouble.

If you want to *really* learn French, take a full-year conversational sequence.","The course is most useful in terms of the practice it provides at translating. Work and review done in the classroom is not necessarily the most helpful aspect of the course."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Stephanie is great!","This class teaches you French in one semester.  There is a lot of work outside the class to be done, but it will have you reading French with a dictionary by the end of the semester.  Good for grad students who need to read the language.","You won't learn to speak, but it's a good way to cover a lot of material in a short time.  If you do the work throughout the course, the skills (and grade) will happen naturally.  If not, it's hard and stressful."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Be sure to take it with Kathy Richman, she makes an otherwise dull course very engaging.","You get as much benefit as the work you put in.","Don't expect go gain more than passive\/reading knowledge; but your reading skills will improve really fast if you keep doing your homework throughout the semester.","By the end of this course, you will be able to make your way through modern French more or less laboriously. You will get most out of the course if you are actively reading\/translating outside of class. Kathy was a wonderful instructor!","The professor sincerely cares for the students, teaching them, and teaching French. Would definitely take another class with her.","Only take it if you have to pass a French translation exam. Otherwise, it's pretty pointless.","This course requires a lot of work, but is very effective in teaching students how to read French.","French for Reading with Kathy Richman was great. She was really understanding that most of the course was made up of graduate students and flexible in assignments when we were too bogged down with other work. I learned the basics of French grammar, which means I should be able to pass a language exam and work on texts for my own work with an online dictionary.","If you need to pass a departmental exam in French, this is the class you need.","I just really don't enjoy learning language at all, which is in no way Dr. Richman's fault-- she was great. I just would recommend that students try to get out of the language requirement if possible, but if someone wanted to learn French for reading, then yes, I would recommend this course.","Don't miss the opportunity to take this course with Kathy Richman-- she's outstanding, and well worth planning your schedule of courses around when she'll be teaching the course!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"5.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"14","response rate":"78.57","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRENCH Ax","course_id":"4377","cat_num":"2763","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRENCH Ax","course_id":"4377","cat_num":"2763","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"8","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRENCH Ax","course_id":"4377","cat_num":"2763","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
