This course is a good way to practice writing proposal and to consider how to go about asking and answering scientific questions.","Although the usefulness of the actual time in class is limited, the practice you get from essentially writing an entire PQE over the course of the semester is invaluable.","requires a lot of writing and a lot of work, but it's all worth it"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This course provides an excellent opportunity to learn how to write a research proposal from start to finish. Throughout the semester, the instructors provide insightful suggestions and constructive criticisms to aid you in going through the process. It forces you to master the presentation of your scientific ideas to others in a convincing manner. In so doing, it also gives you the chance to become more critical of experimental design.  All in all, it is a great chance to prepare for writing PQE's and research in general.","This is a good class. It gives you a dry run for your PQE proposal."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Be emotionally and physically ready for intense work and huge improvement!","Yes, I think it's an invaluable skillset to develop as a young student, though I worry if the effectiveness of the class would not scale with more students in the sections.","This class helped me feel more confident about writing my PQE. I recommend to people who have not done any proposal writing in the past, especially if English is your second language."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"4.00","recommendation":"4.25","enrollment":"8","response rate":"62.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GENETIC 330","course_id":"3132","cat_num":"0210","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GENETIC 330","course_id":"3132","cat_num":"0210","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GENETIC 330","course_id":"3132","cat_num":"0210","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
