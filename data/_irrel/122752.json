'08":{"comments":["It's the best ec course I've taken yet.  The final paper is especially fun.  I'm writing it now and it's just so interesting how applicable the stuff we have learned is to many issues policy-makers face daily.","If you are interested in innovation or product development, this is the course at Harvard for you.","Feedback is scattered and criticism arbitrary at times.","For students interested in international development issues","It's been my favorite class thus far and I very much enjoyed the intimacy of the small class and the subject material is great because it is focused on something you are particularly interested in.","Your experience will vary depending on the instructor.","The section leader is what makes the difference. Choose your tutorial wisely.","This is a great class if you want a tutorial that is fun, interesting, and not too much work. However, you do not do much in the way of modeling or econometric analysis, so if those things interest you, this may not be the course for you.","TF is a great source for information about economics and teaches a very challenging but interesting class.","Readings are a little long but material is useful and interesting.","It's very interesting, and you come out with a completely new mindset.","It's very difficult and a lot of work. However, the material is extremely interesting if you like learning about business corporations.","Be careful how you choose tutorials!","You will work hard, but learn a lot and enjoy most of the class. The final paper is difficult but until then it is not too bad.","Merlina is a dedicated teacher and really knows the material. You will learn a lot through class discussions, that on the whole, were a lot of fun.","It will be a lot of work.  Start your empirical paper early!","One of the best ec tutorials in my opinion. Fairly painless and very interesting.  Jonathan was a phenomenal tf.","Given that they're going to be subjected to 970 no matter what, I would strongly urge them to do Ryan's section.  The classes themselves were legitimately interesting.","Undoubtedly, this is among my favorite classes at Harvard.","tutorial is pretty different from any other ec class i've taken.it was a really fun experience for me, but be sure to consider the class times carefully. mine was in the evening, which made dinner kind of complicated for me twice a week (i hate eating early).","It is a difficult, demanding class, but it pays off.","If you are interested in environmental economics, this is the tutorial you should consider. Not only does it provide you with an array of perspectives and skills on and for this special field, it also enables you to utilize your previously gained knowledge about the principles of economics and statistics by the means of clearly laid out short and research papers. Very informative class, and a fun way to complete your tutorial requirement in a real-life approach!","The material was interesting, but the workload was heavy, and we did not receive much instruction for assignments.","This was one of the best classes I have taken here. I really enjoyed the subject material, the readings, the discussion, the teaching and the assignments. The workload was not overbearing. The papers require a good amount of time if you want to do them correctly, but I learned a great deal in the process.","I would recommend it for students interested in international growth questions, growth in third world countries. But I would definitely have reservations about the quantity of work and reading.","It's required.  Take it.","a good learning experience; small class environment","Your experience depends heavily on your section assignment.","Good course where you get a lot of personal attention, voice your opinions, and learn a lot in an enjoyable way.","The sophomore tutorial is a great way to learn more about a particular topic in economics, drawing on knowledge from both peers and dedicated grad students. While the workload can be daunting at the outset, if you pick a topic you're truly interested in studying, completing assignments will be a welcome way to deepen your understanding rather than an unfortunate and time-consuming requirement.","Choose a subject that you're interested in and a TF who you like.","VERY INTERESTING.","Do the reading.","Though economics concentrators don't have a choice, I really enjoyed this course, as it was my first small course within the department and an intensive introduction to a new subject.","Don't take it unless you have to","Take econometrics","not a very good class, teacher does not accommodate sharing of ideas, plays favorites","Doing well in \"Global Games\" is more about acquiescing to the particular preferences of the section leader than learning anything about game theory or international interactions.","Michael is great, the material is more interesting than you might expect.","Be careful about which section you take, make sure it is one that you will want to do the work for.","This is a class of extremes, there will be days you love it and days you hate it.","make sure you are interested in the field you choose & have taken statistics","wait and take econometrics before taking this class- unfair advantage to people who have taken it","Pay attention to which you pick. Really consider the professors- they make or break the experience because there is a huge variety of teaching styles\/requirements.","Take Global Games","Pick your tutorial leader very carefully!! The TF will make or break the tutorial.","It will give you exposure to small classes and discussions in the Economics Department, as well as improve your writing.","Quite possibly the best class I have taken at Harvard - make sure Michael is teaching it, though.","The instructor was not committed to teaching the class; he was either out for the money, or seriously underestimated the required commitment level.","This is a great way to apply economic theory to real life issues. It is also a great way explore a potential field, which you're interested in.","Slow-paced --> fairly boring, with poor quality grading and comments, a strange choice of background for a TF who was also pretty unaccessible.","Take Urska's class.","Take the game theory class: it's fun, it's exhausting, but overall you'll be glad you did it.","Michael's class was very well design, with very interesting material, great discussions, a fun simulation.","very detail-oriented class, professional, but be aware that the TF does not like contradictions and is inflexible if your ideas do not match his","Choose a topic that interests you because if not, it will be difficult for you to enjoy the readings and participate in class discussion.","This course really teaches you how to write proper papers in general as well as in economics.","Merlina was the best part of the class and so were the business case studies.  They were extremely engaging and very informative for someone who is interested in studying developing markets.","I've heard people in other tutorial topics were happier - I'm sure the sophomore tutorial program could be very rewarding, but I just had a very bad experience in this section.","It is a great way to find out about debates and economic reasoning behind day-to-day issues","I really enjoyed the class a lot, both because of the material, the tools I acquired, and the teaching of Deepa.  I thought that class was very valuable for me in a variety of ways, as well as being very interesting and extremely relevant to many current events issues.","You'll learn a lot, but the workload is heavier and more difficult than other tutorials.","It's great to take an economics class on something that interests you!","First: I based almost my entire decision to make this my first choice on the 2 minute speech that Ryan gave when all of the T.F.s were introducing themselves - basically he seemed normal and engaging - best decision I could have made.  I have heard horror stories from other friends, whereas I really enjoyed my tutorial.  Second: the topic is actually extremely interesting and fun.","Take Bryan Sawers section, you will not regret it.","Great course.  Good structure although the specifics are up to the TF.\r\nIf you are interested in corporate governance, you will enjoy it a lot.","Great class for learning to think about economics.  The class does a very good job addressing interesting and important topics.","The best way to write the papers is to go about researching, planning, and outlining them as though the policies you propose will actually be implemented.  This helped me really own my topics\/policies and fine-tune them to the best of my ability.","Lots and lots of reading, so be prepared. Section leaders choose curriculum based on their own interests, so you may feel very bored some weeks."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["Great course","The Ec970s are extremely different from each other.","Never boring.  Great reads.","It is only useful if you are concentrating in economics or writing a thesis relating to economics.","Do not take this class.","great class, learn a lot from it.","There is a lot of meticulous reading.","Make sure you really think about your preferences before choosing a section to take.  Some of the classes are really intense, while some are more fun.  Research the classes carefully.","Take this class if you get the chance.","No one takes it who it's not required of, so this question is moot.","Difficult but rewarding. Especially worthwhile if Deepa is the TF.","Background in information technology is helpful but not required. Students should have an interest in learning about technology companies and business strategy.","no matter how hard you work for this class, Saad will either like your paper or not and that will make or break your grade. and the biggest problem with that is that you'll never understand what exactly it is that he likes","Make sure you pick your graduate students wisely. They make or break the course. Don't pick based on what topic interests you the most, but rather on how good you think the grad student is.","The subject is great, but sometimes it can be overwhelming to have to think of good paper ideas. The readings can be boring, but others are interesting.","If you've ever wondered about how economics is relevant to policy, this is the class. We go through policy implications and prominent studies that will equip you with the information and analytical skills to determine the costs and benefits of policies.","good course to take if you are interested in the subject matter but probably more difficult than most other sophomore tutorials.","interesting and thought-provoking","interesting course, must do the readings","This class was taught at an excessively advanced level of econometric applications.  Feedback was sparse and unpunctual, and the grading seemed unfair at times given the difficulty of the assignments.  That said, the readings were very interesting, and I certainly feel that I learned a lot from the course.","Have some background knowledge in finance, microeconomics, and preferably corporate governance; if not, do some outside readings on the basics; also, participation matters","This course is an incredible tutorial, and Rajiv was great.","The subject is interesting, but it gets old after a while.","Make sure the material interests you, and be prepared to write.","Be careful which section you choose.  It can make all the difference in your 970 experience.","horrible","It's required","I wouldn't recommend a course taught by Mr. Nicolov, but I've heard that there are some really good Ec 970 courses.","This course was a great, applied way to learn econometrics.  Unfortunately, this course won't work the same way without Daniel =(","It is an excellent class if you are interested in the material. If it is not something which you would like to study it may not be the best course for you.","The reading can be substantive but it was my favorite course within the economics department. I learned a lot!","Economics of the Family provides a very interesting look at microeconomics!","a lot of work, but very interesting class","This might be the hardest course in the economics department.","Great exposure to  current academic economics writing \/ debate \/ issues and introduction to writing  economics papers  \/ social science papers more generally.  Section leader greatly influences the success of the course.  Interest in the material is helpful.","Great material, some of the readings are very dense though. Participate actively throughout the semester and provide insights that further the conversation in order to have a high participation grade.","Tough, but fun. You will come out of this tutorial learning something.","One of the best classes I've had here at Harvard - probably the best.","Vladmir is a great TF, honest, with real experience to draw on, and a unique perspective having lives so many places and done so many things.","i would recommend this particular section, economics of the family, though i assume it won't be taught next year as my tutorial leader is graduating","I like the tutorial aspect of Economics. I think maintaining tutorials should be a top priority for the Ec department during the national recession.","Unfortunately, Rajiv's ego and personality crowd out a potential opportunity to learn about game theory.","Very exciting!","I would tell students that you learn some good things about economics, but the work is tedious and difficult and the discussions in class often drag on and get very boring.","The course can be frustrating, but if you are thinking of writing a senior paper in economics and\/or health it will be incredibly usefull.","This is one of the best Economics course I've taken at Harvard. I would encourage everyone to take Economics of the Family.","there's not one basic thing that you learn and build upon like other classes. in this class, you learn about many different things such as cost of wars, sanctions, national defense, terrorism, etc.","great topics of discussion, very relevant to life as a responsible ad informed citizen.","Very good instructor, a lot of work, good opportunity to learn a lot about research in economics and gain a good understanding of the breadth and depth in economics, discusses cutting edge research, projects are somewhat tedious and confusing. You will become fairly competent in stata.","A lot of work.","Do the readings","Excellent class; do not be dissuaded by challenging material.","Great discussions but can be slightly frustrating due to lack of good data sets.","Do applied math\/ec--better signaling and no need to do tutorial. I guess it's nice to meet people who are also ec concentrators, but too much effort","Grading is difficult, but readings are interesting and you will learn so much.","If you are willing to put in the time, you will learn a lot about writing Economics papers and you'll get a decent grade. If you don't, the class will be a pain and you won't do well.","The class does not require too much work, but you do learn a lot and it is worth it.","This is a good class to get the basics of game theory but beyond that, it is a bit disorganized and not efficient.","Alejandra is fantastic! Too bad she won't be back next year :(","If you are at all interested in libertarian economics, please consider taking this tutorial.  It has been an eye opening experience.","Be prepared to do work that you aren't prepared for with little to no outside help.","Get your papers done ahead of time.","Interesting topics and a good instructor.  Somewhat difficult and requires a decent amount of work, but explores a new area of economics that most people don't experience.","It's definitely worth considering!","Your only chance during your undergraduate career to be in a small, interactive setting to discuss economic issues. Fun course!","This particular section might not be as academically strong as other sections, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't take it seriously. That said, grading is erratic.","Do all of the readings to maximize the benefit of the course.","Arguably the best (most interesting AND rewarding) Ec 970 class.","Very fun tutorial where you learn to clearly express your ideas in economic terms.","It was very interesting and well taught.","The market is in bad shape at the moment, now I know why.","This is a great class and you can really get a lot out of it if you're willing to work hard and engage with the material. The TF has a lot of influence on how sections are run, so the course varies a lot from section to section.","Moderate amount of readings involved. Econometric methods highly recommended.","This class is very inspiring in terms of most up-to-date trends in technology and its economic theories underlying.","you should have a strong background in econometrics, otherwise you will struggle","This class is one of the most reading intensive sophomore tutorial and one should therefore be willing to do some work when enrolling.","Economics of IT is hard, but I've learned a lot more useful and memorable information here than I've learned in other economics classes. Because discussion is mandatory, everyone does the reading. This might sound like a pain -- but it's good, because you learn a lot.","Requires strong math background.","Jonathan Borck is the man.","You learn a lot, you are much more knowledgeable about how other areas of the world operate, and last of all, it's fun. \r\n\r\nYou will learn a lot of tidbits of information that may be useful later on, whether in further research or interviews...","Sawers is a great TF","It is very practicle knowledge that you will be glad you know.  you can now participate in conversations about all the things that Harvard Students go on to do after they graduate (Hedge Funds, Private Equity)","This course covers a variety of topics that are dominating the headlines and provides an in depth look at these issues.","It's not easy or fluffy like you might assume based on the title. And it's NOT a philosophy class.","We have to take the course","Significant writing is required, but for Law and Economics the topics are open and you can pursue what you want. Discussions are great and it is a good break from the large economics courses.","It is a rigorous economics class. A must if the person is interested in Libertarianism.","It is hard work, but is a great tutorial, very interesting, and a unique opportunity -- even among all the other sophomore tutorial offerings.","This course provides an excellent background for corporate governance, corporate law, and private equity.","This is the best course I've taken at Harvard. The TF was great, the discussion was engaging, and I am so glad that I got to experience a class like this before I graduate.","Excellent practical approach altho needs some structure.","This course teaches you to think outside of the box and approach controversial issues in a completely new manner.","Be comfortable with econometrics and Stata before taking it","makes you conversant in economic matters and helps you form opinions on current economic issues.","This course is ridiculous.  The TFs are great, but the volume of written work required is unnecessarily huge.  Overall, I liked section but hated the workload.","only take if you are an ec concentrator","this class will help you understand what is happening in the financial and corporate world, so it is very applicable for when you graduate","Great Tutorial if you want to learn a lot and challenge yourself","If you are interested in writing and thesis and\/or learning how to write economics papers this is a good introductory class to take.","It's a fine class if you have a good TF and a subject you're interested in; lack either, and it will much tougher. It's unfortunate that this is a hoop the economics department requires everyone to jump through, despite no sign of a standardized education between all the different sections.","Only take this section if you are interested in topics on education and are willing to put a lot of work into the class.","The class does require some work; however, you will learn a lot. For me, it helped enlighten me on the research and methods behind the field of economics.","This class will favor those students who have taken econometrics previous to enrolling in the course.  Overall, it was a rewarding experience and I think it should be part of the requirements for economics concentrators.  However, a major review of section teachers should be done to weed out those that performed poorly.  Although my section teacher was fantastic, I continuously heard horror stories from other sections.","I would tell them that I enjoyed the class and that I learnt a lot.","If you are interested in international business or economic policy, it is a good course to take.","An interesting tutorial that intertwines theory, real-world application and economic analyses.","The small group atmosphere will aid you in learning a lot about whatever subject material you choose, and it will give you a chance to get to know a teacher very well.","Because the class has a heavy focus on law reviews, it is not very helpful in building an econometric intuition for reading academic papers.  Therefore, I recommend this class if you are actually interested in the subject material.","Expect a lot of reading, mandatory participation, frequent papers, research","The work will be difficult, and it won't be a GPA boost, but you will come out of it having learned a lot more that you expected to.","It's a good learning experience.  Be prepared for a lot of reading.","This class is my favorite class that I have taken at Harvard.","This class is the best class I have taken thus far at Harvard. I learned so much about the current issues of the environment. I also learned a great deal about monetizing nonmarket goods.","Take a quant level that you're comfortable with or else the work load can be significantly more than you bargained for.","On the bright side, this course requires very little work outside of class.  However the con is that you won't really learn all that much about economics. Most of the course involves looking at various legal cases."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["A very interesting course.","This tutorial is incredible, and if you're interested in development you couldn't spend a semester taking a better class. That recommendation is highly contingent on having Dr. Gajwani as the instructor though.","It's required for ec concentrators, so not too much you can do about it. Just pick a good TF, I guess.","This particular tutorial was extremely well organized.  It is rather difficult to get all the reading done, so make sure you're not taking any really hard classes.  This course is extremely worth it, though.","This class is very rewarding, but it requires a lot of work."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["I liked this course because I was genuinely interested in the topic. The TFs are engaging and very nice. Be prepared for the reading and the writing, but that goes in general for any Ec tutorial.","worthwhile","a lot of reading","I learned a lot and I feel that I can open the Wall St Journal at any time and understand what's going on in the markets.","Very interesting if they enjoy applying macro models to current international economics","The subject matter is definitely interesting especially because it deals with real world issues and allows you to conduct your own analysis of a problem that needs to be solved and the most efficient solution available. However, though the TFs are very nice and helpful, class can sometimes fail to be engaging because of a repetitive format.","The course has a lot of reading and work, but in the end it definitely pays off, as you learn and do a lot that will help you later in life.","It is very practical if you want to enter finance.  The best class I've taken at Harvard in that regard.","I found this class to be very rewarding, but be prepared to work.  Come to class everyday having done all the readings ready to actively participate and contribute.","This is an awesome class. I learned a lot about investments and made me excited for my investment internship this summer.","you'll learn how to write econ papers","(About Economics of Health and Development with Plamen Nikolov) \r\nIt sounds like a nice course and the material is really interesting. You will learn a lot about health and development. \r\nHowever, Plamen is pretty disorganized. Also, the empirical assignment will be kind of difficult and the final paper will be totally ridiculous. At times, I felt like he expected us to write a senior thesis. Or maybe a PhD dissertation. Plamen's expectations were sort of high for what were actually capable of doing. \r\nAlso, Plamen uses SAS and doesn't know how to use Stata. Just watch out for that.","That the readings can be tough but the class is very interesting and involves transactions made every day in every persons life.","A lot of readings but you learn a lot too.","The material is interesting!  Jenn is a willing and helpful tutorial leader!","This is a good class o take if you want to exposed to how big companies work and reasons behind the strengths and downfalls of them. It is a good preparation for interviews as you are required to study and analyze case studies","The best class, if you are interested in development.","Roy is very enthusiastic about the subject matter and very knowledgeable. This class taught me how to think critically about the material rather than just take information I read as given. My writing skills improved tremendously throughout the semester. Definitely the best course I have taken at harvard.","you don't have a choice","Plamen's section on Health and Development was really great.  The assignments were designed to really prepare you for thesis work in economics, and the readings selected were an excellent sampling of the economics literature in the field.  Plamen's great at keeping the class interesting and fun, and it's really low-pressure with the intention of actually teaching you rather than competition for grades.","From what I've heard from friends who took other tutorials, this one's probably one of the best!","This class is extremely interesting. Ricardo is a very helpful instructor who has a vast knowledge of the subject material. He can direct you to any papers, professors, or books about any subject in which you are interested.","its a very practical class.","The best tutorial there is---the material examines the most interesting topics in economics. Also great for students interested in the law.","I was highly impressed  by the economics sophomore tutorial. Even though it is a concentration requirement, my section was wonderful. I loved my classmates, my TF, and the material we discussed. While the class met for a hour and a half twice a week, it didn't feel that long, because we were always engaged in debate or learning about the law. The small size of each tutorial section makes the experience so much better. I am sad thinking about how it might be the only small Harvard economics class that I have the opportunity to take!","if you are someone that will self-motivate your way through the course and take it upon yourself to do additional research then you can get a fuller grasp of game theory. If you prefer instruction from the preceptor to make sense of the material then doesn't expect too much.","This course changed how I viewed management of a company and the idea of globalization. It involved moderately difficult readings but that were interesting and definitely worth reading. In all, if I had to choose which tutorial to take, I would choose Sanjay's.","Do this class if you like information tech material","Best class I've taken at Harvard.  This is how I knew I picked the right concentration.","Incredibly interesting material. Absolutely worthwhile for anyone interested in pursuing a career in global health.","It's refreshing to learn about economics applied to a field other than business or finance. The economics of law is super interesting - especially if you are interested in law school.","This class requires a lot of commitment. But if one learns to analyze the readings to the level that is required, the rewards are immense and will pay off not only in future academic classes but also in life as an understanding of economics will help one navigate the complexities of the globalized economy.","Great class.","This course is definitely interesting, but a little overwhelming in terms of the material learned, even for people very much interested in health and economics. Therefore, i would recommend this course only to people who have a definitive interest in health economics and not someone who is simply looking for any tutorial.","if you are at all interested in game theory, you'll love this class.","Try and get one of Vladimir's courses. He is the best econ guy at Harvard.","if you do all of the reading, you will take a lot out of it","good class, strong law focus, but very interesting topics","For people interested in saving health care, this will definitely point you in the right direction.","It's amazing. Take it even if you don't plan to be an ibanker but you are just interested what they do","This class was unbelievable.  It provides students with fundamental understandings of various health systems and does so in an economic context.","An excellent course, great instructor, interesting materials, covers just about every major issue in development today. If you're at all interested in development, this is a fantastic class.","The subject matter was interesting, the readings a bit repetitive. The assignments probably could have been more clear, but overall it was a decent class.","This class reminds you why you chose Harvard over every other school.","This is an excellent, interesting, and well-taught class. The workload is fair, the readings are selected well and give a good survey of the field, discussion is good, and the TF (Jenn Larson) is excellent. Everything is presented in a way that is easy to comprehend. I pretty much never actually enjoy classes but I was very glad to have taken this one.","Be prepared to spend a lot of time reading and not feel that you have really gotten that much out of it. also be prepared to kind of feel like you are writing a thesis for your final paper without the necessary statistical tools (unless you have taken econometrics)","Take Brett's tutorial if you're interested in law.","This course was an absolutely wonderful introduction to the theory and application of international business and globalization.","Be prepared to do a lot of work for the final paper.","This class makes economics very interesting for those who get bored of dry courses.","Ec10; I would say that econometrics would be helpful on both the empirical assignment and the research seminar.","This is a great class that makes you look critically at a lot of policy and initatives from an environmental economics perspective; you really come away knowing a lot more about what goes into creating and passing this type of policy.","This is a great tutorial. Brandon is great and encourages a lot of interesting discussions and debates. The assignments are challenging but not inordinately so.","It was a good class, Sanjay was a very fair tutorial leader. Be ready for some quant in the readings and assignments.","Brandon deserves the highest possible recommendation.  If you ever have the opportunity to do a class with him, take it.","Roy is the best TF Iv'e had at Harvard.\r\nThis tutorial was awesome, TAKE IT!","This is a great class - Roy is very smart and very encouraging. Make sure you stay on top of the reading and have a solid econometric background.","This class could be great--but make sure its a different professor.","Try to be creative in your assignments","The readings that we read in this course towards the latter half were interesting, but we spent more time on property and liability rules than I expected after reading the syllabus.","This class was fun if you like technology.","The discussion is great, Bradley is a fantastic section leader.","Fantastic course, engaging material, outstanding instructor.","Jenn is a good teacher.","Especially for students who are interested in exploring a relatively new field and seeing how the same tools can be applied in totally new and different ways to augment existing research.","The course was extremely boring and in general, the section leader had difficulty conveying any sort of a point.","You must be willing to work hard and take the time to really understand what you are reading to be successful in the class. It's not enough to just skim.","The sophomore tutorial is hit or miss -- there is no way to know how good your TF will be. I would advise narrowing it down by the topics that interest you, then looking at the syllabus to see how the writing requirements compare.","-great class, you can get as much out of it as you want","Really great sophomore tutorial.","It's great to be able to take a small class in such a big concentration.","Be prepared to put a lot of time into the readings if you want to be at the forefront of the discussions.","Very engaging and interesting","unless you really like interventions related to health care don't take","If you are interested in international business this is a great class.","Take childhood health interventions if not for the interesting subject matter then for the amazing instructors! This course will challenge you, and you will work A LOT, but it will be rewarding in the end.","The most important thing about Economics 970 is to actually select a topic you are interested in.","The material is interesting and practical. Definitely consider taking it if you are interested in landing a job in the finance world","This course serves as a great introduction to the field of developmental economics. There is a lot of reading and writing, but you learn a tremendous amount about the subject matter and about writing for economics.","This is a great tutorial!  Definitely take it if you want to learn a lot about a new topic that isn't commonly covered in the Econ department at Harvard.  There is a lot of work required compared to other tutorials, but it's definitely worth it if you put in the effort!","This is an interesting class, but you must be a self-starter and someone that is not easily frustrated by poor grades. You will learn a lot, but this will mostly come from yourself.","This class is not a piece of cake, but is very worthwhile for anyone who wants to be exposed to important macroeconomic issues to the U.S. and the world.","It is a difficult class in terms of work load, but the best class i've taken at harvard.","Jenn is an amazing TF, but be prepared for some pretty technical readings.","Kiran was an excellent TF; most of the readings and assignments are interesting, especially if you're interested in development economics; in general, if you're interested in development economics at all, this is great choice for a sophomore tutorial","If you're willing to put in the time and really think about what you're learning it becomes a very rewarding course.","If you are interested in development economics, I would highly recommend the course!! While the course required a considerable amount of work, all our readings and the topics we covered were very interesting, so the work didn't end up being that bad. Kiran is a great teacher and you will learn a lot about writing economics papers from her.","A lot of work, but worth the pain.","Great for anyone with interest in development or health economics.  Strong emphasis on empirical methods as well as theory.  A GREAT class teaching empirical data analysis and paper writing, perfect preparation for thesis writing.","Pay attention to the quantitative level when picking a tutorial more so than the subject matter, especially if you haven't taken econometrics yet.","Enter the class with a willingness to learn, and you will achieve much.","Try to get a topic that interests you.  Sean Cameron and financial investments was incredible.  Also, look to see which section have short paper requirements.","This seminar focuses on the economic evaluation of child interventions, but the skills gained can be applied to interventions of all types, and are very useful for the study of economics as a whole.","This is a good course to take if you don't want the traditional econ tutorial (finance-related). The material is interesting and the professor is a plus.","Be prepared to do all the reading if you want to do well in the class--each class is very reading-specific.","you can win money","Make sure you like the topic that you sign up for!","Very interesting material, you learn quite a bit, but could be more engaging.","hard but worth it","An unrivaled class at Harvard, especially in the economics department."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Make sure you have a basic understanding of Congress, government, and the way monetary policy works","Very interesting class. Roy was a great TF and led the discussions very well. Overall, we learned a lot about the \"messy factors\" that govern our behavior - social norms, morals, etc. This course was less about law and more about the other systems of control that affect our behavior. An interesting perspective on corporate law.","I've heard many horrible things about these tutorials but Kristin is amazing! She analyzed every paper thoroughly in order to help us improve our writing and she was very fair in her grading. Her classes were not intimidating and she encouraged a sort of camaraderie between us students so the 1.5 hours didn't drag on. It was A LOT of work, but it was worthwhile work.","Take the one you're most interested in","This course will test your understanding of Economic theory and push you to develop a more sophisticated and educated viewpoint of the topic you choose to study.","Best class I have taken so far at Harvard. Very practical for those interested in finance","Social Economics is a great course if you want to learn about all sorts of exciting topics that explore behavioral and social phenomena - happiness, social inequality, charity giving, measuring morality, importance of experiments, etc. The field is very different from what you're used to in micro\/macro series. Ricardo is incredibly knowledgeable and can easily guide you to any sources that may be of interest. The class atmosphere is relaxed and open to discussion, but don't forget it's worth putting effort into the readings and class presentations.","Jenn Larson's Networks class has been the best class that I have ever experienced. The topic was incredibly interesting, the readings were relevant, and the assignments were challenging but also somehow incredibly enjoyable. Classes like this are why I came to Harvard--I want to turn this into a thesis topic now!","This was an awesome course. Make sure you get excited about the material (hopefully you get placed in a good tutorial), and engage in the conversations. When discussions are fun and interesting, this was one of the most enjoyable classes that I have taken at Harvard.","Very interesting. Roy is great and makes it fun to learn.","Make sure you find the right TF or else you will be in for a miserable semester. If you get a bad TF, leave the class and take it next year.","Quant level 3 tutorials are hard, but well worth it as long as you find a topic that you are interested in. Econometrics and game theoretic background are probably not necessary, but will be very useful since you will actually be able to understand what the author of the paper is talking about in his model. This tutorial was really great and the material was very interesting, but be prepared to invest a considerable amount of time in the class.","The experience varies substantially across tutorials; Andrew Coe's was challenging, but made me feel like I was actually on my way to producing something like an actual economist.","I really learned a lot from this course-not only the specific topic of the section, but also how to think and write like an economist, which I think it a very useful skill to have.","This course is one of the best I've taken at Harvard.  The class sizes are small and the materials are interesting.  You get to know your TFs and classmates well through discussions and debates.  Great course.","An interesting but math-heavy introduction to an interesting sub-field in economics.","Sadly, Kristin Wilson won't be teaching again next year. She was one of the most committed and helpful TF I've known. She put time into preparing for class, was great at breaking down complex concepts from the readings to help us understand, and gave us concrete and helpful feedback (unlike Expos).","Fantastic course.  Vladimir is very passionate about finance, and it shows in the quality of the class discussion.  Though the class is geared toward investment banking, it gives a great overview of corporate workings (esp. accounting)  and the history of firm acquisition activity.","Take this class if you want some financial experience to determine whether you want to be in the industry or not. It will also put you in front of many of your colleagues in preparation for internships.","Roy is awesome and the class is very manageable.","This is THE course to take if you want to go into finance or have an interest in learning every concept you would ever need for ALL of your interviews. You'll learn all about corporate governance and a thorough history of M&A activity and LBOs. A truly wonderful course that is unlike any other. I can't say enough good about this course, PRACTICAL and Vlad is a very knowledgeable and understanding tutorial leader.","You'll get more out of the course if you participate. The readings can usually be skimmed pretty easily.","Jessica could make anything fun and interesting. The fascinating course material only helps.","Contract Law one has a very reasonable amount of reading.","Great way to learn about a field that there aren't too many other classes on.","Take if you like learning a lot of about theory. This class is very theory-heavy and almost feels like a gov class sometimes. However, Evan does a great job of applying this theory to real life so it is still very interesting.","Clara is a very knowledgable TF, but the math can be a bit overwhelming.","Great course for studying a very specific section in the economic world.","If you are at all interested in national security, this is the course to take. This offers a strong introduction into the relationship between economics and national security that is both relevant and interesting.","It's one of those classes that you sort of dread to think about or work for during the year, but once your done you realize that it was actually pretty constructive and you're a better \"economist\" for it. Lisa lives and breathes this stuff so she is an awesome resource that shouldn't be undervalued. Overall, it isn't a class I fell in love with, but I learned a lot for sure.","Take it especially if Bob is teaching it.","Depending on which class you take, the readings can be very dense.  However, learning to work through a paper designed for academics and graduate students can be rewarding.","While I have heard that some poepole did not really like their tutorials, mine was great and was one of my favorite classes at harvard. The class was interesting, I learned a lot, and it wasn't that hard. It was also nice to take a more focused econ class after taking several semesters of theory based classes. Overall, though, it seems like the tutorials are hit or miss. choose carefully","Jenn Larson's section is awesome: practical, educational, and fair. Highly recommend Networks! Confidence is more the prerequisite than math skills. Don't be intimidated.","If you take the political economy course, make sure you already have a proficient understanding of political economy and monetary policy, or you'll suffer.","Jan was a great section leader, and experiments in economics offer a promising avenue for further research on a variety of topics.","Professor Neugeboren was fine. Game theory is very interesting. There could have been more discussion (a lot of the time he spent lecturing at us) but there wasn't much work and he gives good feedback.","Networks with Jenn Larson is the best. Jenn is a great teacher and she facilitates great discussion. The material is interesting. The math is a little tricky with networks but if you're willing to put the time in to understand it, you will have a lot of fun in this course.","You will love it if Jessica is teaching it! Fantastic course, and certainly would have taken it again!","Absolutely take Jenn Larson's Networks tutorial - by far the best class I have taken at Harvard.","I thoroughly enjoyed this section for my sophomore tutorial. If you have the chance, definitely take experimental economics, especially if you are interested in behavioral economics. The readings weren't too hard and the topics are all very interesting. The TF was amazing, but unfortunately he will not be teaching here next year. Otherwise, you had sort response papers due weekly that were not too bad and a great setting where you can get to know your classmates through discussion. I really enjoyed the class and would recommend it to any Econ. concentrator.","It's one of those classes that you get as much as you put in.","You'll learn alot about how to read and critique empirical papers. it might help to like the subject matter but it is not necessary.","Probably won't be offered at Harvard in the near future, which is a shame. If it is, take it.","If you're into corporate governance\/law\/corporate social responsibility, this class provides good economics\/legal background to get you thinking about these issues. (Roy Shapira, \"Laws, Markets & Morals)","This class really made me like economics!","This class was the best academic experience I've had at Harvard.  I had a very small section of only 4 people and this created a great classroom environment that facilitated great discussions that really furthered everyone's understanding of our subject (Savings and Social Insurance).  The kind of econometric work we did was very new to me so it was very challenging, but it was also very rewarding .","This is not an easy course and requires you put a lot of effort in to get the most out of it, but if you are willing to give the time it's definitely worth it. I felt like I learned a lot on my own time, but also learned a lot from my peers in class discussion.","Overall this is an okay tutorial, but I was somewhat disappointed. The tutorials are not particularly well organized. You don't need to complete your reading to do your paper, sometimes I found these two components rather detached.","Pay a lot of attention to the topics and the quantitative rating. Also, read through the syllabus so you know how much work you're looking at -- the different sections actually vary considerably in what they ask of you.","Vladimir's section is, by far, the most practically useful class that you will take at Harvard. If you are at all interested in a career in finance and would like to fulfill your sophomore tutorial requirement, I couldn't imagine a better section to take. Plus, Vladimir is a really awesome guy and he really cares about his section and his students. You should definitely make an effort to reach out to him outside of class.","The class is focused heavily on readings. At some point, articles out of different law journals may seem repetitive. However, overall insights about social aspects of economic may prove helpful in future studies and other subjects.","Well, it's a class you have to take as an econ concentrator, so the best you can do is to try to pick a topic you're actually interested in. Be prepared to spend more time than you'd expect to understand some of the more technically advanced papers.","Vladimir taught a really really great course. We learned a ton about real world applications and models. This class will definitely be useful for future interviews and jobs.","This class is a great chance to engage at a deeper level with economics material than students have been able to up until this point.","I would recommend this course because it is very interesting and I learned a lot.  However, it will be challenging.","While this course is extremely time consuming and arduous, it is probably the most useful course offered for preparing for a career in finance.","The course is very interesting and you learn a great deal but be prepared to work a lot and spend a great deal of time on the response papers.","This class is a fun and interesting way to satisfy your economics tutorial requirement.  The topics are relevant to social psychology, sociology, and behavioral economics, which makes the discussions very interesting.","Ricardo was an excellent teacher, the class was extremely well structured and was a great learning environment","Jenn Larson's section on Networks is amazing. The workload isn't too bad and the readings are very interesting covering a wide range of topics from disease spread to crime. You'll gain a new perspective on looking at social networks afterwards. Jenn also makes it easier to understand the more technical material during section, so don't get scared by the quantitative rating.","Can get boring with the same format for every class. Read some articles, discuss them in section, ad nauseam.","This is a great course to learn more about economics and the novel way it can be applied. It also provides a person with solid knowledge of the threats to national security the US faces and the structure of national security.","Papers are graded fairly and generously. However, there is a large amount of reading, and it leans toward the dry side. Kristin is great, though.","Alot of response papers","This is one of the most interesting classes that you can take at Harvard. If you have any interest in National Security in the modern era, then I would strongly recommend this course.","Take Development Economics with Kiran! She is amazing.","I expected the course to not be much work at the beginning of the semester. However, I quickly learned that it is a very time consuming class with a significant amount of reading and writing. However, if you put the time into the class that it deserves, you can actually learn a significant amount about economics research. Very useful, although at times difficult, class.","If you do the readings it will be a lot more enjoyable as the class is all discussion-based.","This course gives you the tools to think critically about empirical evidence and to evaluate the arguments of academic papers. I will definitely use the insights that I have been given in this class in my future work in development.","Great material and the section leader is very approachable and fosters a great learning environment.","Ricardo is a great TF.  You should take course with him. He is enthusiastic about the course and very friendly.  Readings are sometimes overwhemling but enjoyable most of time.","You will find the Household and Consumer Finance tutorial difficult if you have not taken econometrics.","You should be really sorry that Andrew is leaving Harvard. He created a fascinating course that combined his background in political science and government with the brilliant use of economic tools of analysis. With some luck, he'll end up back at Harvard teaching at some point.","Networks with Jenn Larson: Jenn is one of the greatest section leaders I have had. Jenn guided our discussions, explained everything clearly and concisely, and made us comfortable with sharing our opinions. This is one of the most eye-opening classes I have taken; the topic is timely and relevant, and networks has so many applications in the real world.","Take it only if you are very interested in the subject.","Contemporary Debates in Development Economics is a must-take if you're interested in studying development. Kiran is great and the class attracts people that are interested in development economics. Somewhat difficult, but worth it.","Excellent course! Very intetesting readings","Networks is the best tutorial! Jenn is a fantastic TF, and the course material is really cool. Networks is a growing field and is very interesting given the importance of the internet and social networking today. I really learned a lot from the tutorial and had a great time!","Daniel is great and will be very helpful to anyone taking this class. Assignments are flexible, in that you are free to choose research topics that interest you. Finally, China is a very fascinating country, and I definitely feel like I know more about Chinese politics and economics now than I did back in January.","Make sure that the topic you choose is something you're passionate about! You'll gain a lot more from tutorial if it's a topic you enjoy and are excited about! Also, Elia is a phenomenal teacher!","If Andrew Coe teaches a section again you should take his section! While it may be a bit harder and require more work than some other sections, you will learn A TON (and it will be worth it). You will come out with a real solid understanding of modeling and regressions and the limitations and benefits of each. Plus you will learn this through applying the concepts to why war occurs (which is just cool).","Definitely take Economics of National Security with J. Blankshain. One of the most knowledgable, fair, and awesome TFs.","It is a hard class, but it is necessary and teaches you a lot.","It is a great class. More math involved than I expected, but the teacher is always willing to help.","The tutorial on Networks taught by Jenn Larson is a very well taught tutorial. You are able to learn a lot by keeping up the readings and Jenn is very easy to talk to. She also always very helpful in helping you with your models and provides great suggestions.","This is a great class if you're interested in investment banking as a career.  Teaches you how to analyze financial statements, do modeling, and other useful skills.","You have to take it, but try to get into a tutorial that you are interested in because it makes the semester much easier","The class covered some interesting material in a pretty painless fashion.","Be prepared to work to understand this syllabus. Some of the papers are very technical, and Alice isn't the most gregarious of TFs.","Tough, but interesting. Not a lot of good resources.","Be prepared to do most work without much structure to assignments. But overall the the class was interesting","Quant level 3 is CHALLENGING. You'll see economic models unadulterated and read challenging papers. It is rewarding, but be prepared to work for it.","You might not think you're interested in Consumer Finance. But you are. Your life depends on it.","Exploring the budding field of networks is very exciting, but unfortunately, given it's novelty, it is at times left in this ambiguous place between sociology and economics. Students searching for a rigorous economics tutorial, as far as Q3-level tutorials go, might be left a bit dissatisfied with many discussions that stray from econometric rigor and instead tend to focus on the heuristics of networks and network theory.","The sections are hit or miss. (This year, mostly miss). I learned very little in mine, it felt like a waste of time. In general, the courses are all taught by graduate students (most of them not even in the economics department), which is disappointing. Make sure you pick a topic you enjoy at least, if you have to take the class. If you enjoy the topic you can teach it to yourself better.","Take this class if you like political science and economics, and if the Fed interests you (or just central banking's place in a state's government), then take this course, you'll enjoy it.","This course is very interesting and relevant to what is going on in the US economy today! I recommend that students take this tutorial. There was a lot of reading (books and articles), but they were all very intriguing and class discussion made you think critically about the readings and formulate your own opinions on controversial topics concerning the Fed. If you really like political economy or monetary policy, you should definitely take this course!","This course is great, very interesting, and the teacher was top-notch","I took the Network Analysis tutorial with Jenn Larson. It was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Harvard. The field is fascinating and you have the opportunity to actually do new and interesting research. Jenn is a fantastic tutorial leader. She really knows her stuff and does a great job of explaining some of the math complexities from the readings. Don't let the 3 quant level scare you away: this is an awesome seminar that you should definitely take.","\"Social Preferences in Economics\" was a fantastic tutorial!  It demonstrated the various ways in which classical economic theory's assumption of self-interested agents fails to accurately explain human behavior.  The course's combination of theoretical, experimental, and empirical papers allowed its students to explore a variety of econ research, and the TF's diligence and familiarity with the material made for an efficient, well-run course.  While many of the papers assigned were more challenging than those in other tutorials (and our writing assignments were often stricter), this was a great tutorial!","The class is easy; there's not much reading (actually there's some reading, but you don't have to do it). The problem is that you will not learn anything at all","The sophomore tutorial is required for concentrators, but since there are so many topics to choose from and the courses are taught by instructors who really care about their topic, it can be a pretty good time. Small sections are also good for discussion and getting to know your instructor","Amazing. Pick a seminar you're interested in and it will be your best class at Harvard.","The TF has a very high standard for writing and she assigns graduate level readings."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Evan is a great TF. You learn about the Fed and the US\/global economies in this course and really get a good sense of what's going on with current events. Highly recommended","Hope that you get put into Vladimir's mergers and acquisitions class. Most definitely one of the best classes offered at Harvard. Gives you a real taste of what a career in finance is all about.","The best course I've ever taken. If you get into M&A and LBOs, consider yourself extremely lucky. Vlad is great and really cares about teaching. It's without question the most practical course you'll ever take at Harvard (it's basically Investment Banking 101), and the modeling practice you get is amazing. It's definitely a lot of work, especially the assignments, but definitely worth it. Start early on the assignments!","Super interesting topic and relevant to understanding where and why economics cannot always predict a perfect outcome. Participation is key so be prepared to talk. Good thing about this is that apart from reading, the writing is minimal (5 thought papers). Only hard thing is trying to find a good topic for midterm and final papers. Takes the most time but especially important to use the resources around including the Stata TF.","Just skim the cases, digest the overarching topic. Then question it, question your questioning, then question that questioning. Law is the art of argument.","Hillel is such a great TF, is really helpful, and genuinely interested in and invested in the material.","Extremely interesting, interactive class.","Sophomore tutorial is required of concentration so you have to take it. If you have any remote interest in a career in finance, apply to be int Vladimir Bosiljevac's M&A tutorial. THERE IS A HUGE WORKLOAD. But you will learn the most of any course you have taken at Harvard in terms of practical skills & knowledge.","This class is not only a great introduction to contract law, but is an amazing opportunity for self-discovery. Yonatan provides a great forum for discussion and allows your interests to guide the class.","The Evolution of Game Theory was a good Econ seminar. Interesting.","If you care about poverty, and want to really get to know the topic, take this course.","Tutorial is a great way to immerse yourself in an area of economics that really interests you. Although Tom won't be here next year, I still recommend \"The Economics of Attention\" if it's still offered -- really fascinating introduction to behavioral economics.","Amazing course.  Vlad is a fantastic teacher and truly cares about the success of his students.  Will teach you a great deal of what you need to know to succeed in finance.","Its difficult however, its very interesting and I believe you really get out what you put in. If your looking for an easy tutorial this is not the one for you. If your looking for a tutorial in which you want to learn and put in some time and effort then this is the class for you.","If you're interested in breaking the rational-agent-model of classical economics, Roy's Laws, Markets, and Morals is the perfect ec tutorial. An interesting and often light reading load, and you'll discuss everything from social norms, to religion, to corporate philanthropy. The material is great, requirements completely fair, and Roy is wonderful.","This class is great if you have a profound interest in institutional investing. Kyle has great wisdom to offer and makes sure you are exposed to tons of research on the topic.","(I took \"Global Games\" with Rajiv)\r\nthe tutorial is required of Ec concentrators, so it's not like you can get out of it. I rather liked mine, although it was somewhat frustrating how all the work seemed to pile up at the end of the course. some people might not be prepared for the level of some of the readings, either.","Do the readings before you get to class so you can participate in the discussion!","Arash is the best - take his tutorial on Inequality and Justice. He's fun and understanding, and adapts the course to your interests. It's almost guaranteed to be small, and as a result, I had one of the best learning experiences of my years here. The class blends philosophy, economic theory, and empirical work to give a rigorous treatment of an important topic that is always in the news but never approached in depth: inequality. The readings are demanding, but exposes you to professional economics in a way that's rarely done well in other courses.","avoid if possible.","This is one of the best and hardest classes I have taken at Harvard. However this is also given I want to do this stuff in the future. You should really want to go into banking or something similar in order to take this course as you will be doing a lot of work with models in excel. There's a high learning curve but you learn so much and it is extremely useful for interviews or preparation for a summer internship. Lots of work so definitely stay ahead of it - actually though.","I took the M&A and LBO's tutorial with Vladimir. It was amazing. The subject matter is extremely interesting, and you learn a ton about the history of M&A, as well as some practical skills that are crucial if you want to go into the field. Although the workload can be extremely intense at times, Vladimir is very helpful. This is definitely the best course I've taken at Harvard so far.","Tutorial is great! It is a great way to take the concepts you've learned in the larger theoretical ec courses like Ec 10, Ec 1010a\/b, or Ec 1011a\/b and apply them to something in the real world. No matter what type of economics you are interested in, there is a section that will probably suit your desires. Also, the final term paper requirement really helps you build your economics writing skills and get a taste of what research is like.","Global Games was an interesting class. I have not enjoyed a class as much as I enjoyed G.G., but it was also very challenging at times.","Professor Randall is awesome - and using models to make the world a better place (aka evaluating policies on poverty, education, and job training) is so much fun, and makes you feel like you are actually doing something constructive.","I took the behavioral economics section and I felt it was well put together and sufficiently challenging. The best part is that Alex is willing to make changes frequently to the syllabus if students feel like they are not getting enough out of the class. Be prepared for a lot of heavy reading. It's meant to train you to process information quickly and understand key ideas but it can be tough to get used to.","This course has a slightly higher workload than normal but is well worth the extra effort.","It's a great class about relevant and interesting topics analyzed from an economic POV. This makes for great class discussions and personal intellectual growth. I appreciate that it brings in the social component to economic analysis because too often the department ignores that. The work is also very manageable. Take this one!","This is a great course but be warned that it is as much of a political science class as it is a economics class.","Felt like I accomplished something when I finished this class but required my full attention the entire semester.","Hillel is the best. Take Ec of Law if you can.","Tough class be prepared","M&A, LBOs is a great class in which you will learn a ton. Definitely be prepared to work.","This course is a really great way to learn about different fields in economics.","Roy is still around for at least one more year, so definitely try to get into his section -- his tutorial has great discussions, interesting readings, and spans the breadth of the social sciences while still tying it to topics relevant to anyone interested in economics and the corporate world.","Jessica's \"National Security\" was wonderful. At times, the readings got tedious, but the class is very doable, and Jessica is a fantastic section leader. It's too bad she's not teaching it again next year.","This course is great, because it allows you to study a subject more closely that really interests you. Take it, and be excited to do so.","Be prepared to work hard and to struggle at times. Don't take if you are looking for an easy class.","I can see this class ranging from amazing to horrible, depending on who leads your section. Fortunately Evan was a very knowledgeable and helpful TF.","If Radoslav is teaching, just know that he's not very personable which can discourage positive engagement with the material","Kyle is great. If you get him, you will have a great semester.","Good learning experience","The game theory tutorial with Rob Neugeboren is a great sophomore tutorial option. It is interesting and very well taught, though sometimes the focus of the class gets lost.","If you find a section you are truly interested in this will be a very enjoyable class.","It is a great class that truly teaches you a lot about risk and the insurance market.","Great way to decide whether economics is for you, if you're considering an economics concentration (even if you're not currently ec), you should take it to get the requirement out of the way - good practice reading econ papers and writing your own","If you want to go into private equity or investment banking you would be a fool not to take this course. Your section will essentially become a mini-investment bank.","stay on top of readings - even if you think you can read lightly in the beginning, it helps to have a good grasp of material throughout the semester.","Although Kyle was a nice guy, I would not recommend taking this class if it is an option again as a tutorial next year. Although the material is fairly interesting, very few economic concepts were actually discussed and background knowledge on the topic would provide a huge advantage. The amount of reading at the beginning of the class was frequently unmanageable, although this was improved. Little feedback was given on assignments until halfway through the class, especially on your level of participation, at which point half of your participation grade was set in stone and the only way to improve your participation grade was through peer reviews (even if you made an effort to participate more in class after this point). On the whole, the expectations for this class (especially for the empirical assignment and final paper) seemed to be a bit unreasonable and from what I have heard from peers were far higher than normal when compared to other sophomore tutorials.","Evan is great. My favorite part of the course was when we talked about current events in the beginning of each class.","Daniel is a great instructor. He is very approachable, and gives a lot of feedback on all of the assignments. The material was also really interesting, especially if you don't know much about Chinese politics or economics.","There is definitely a lot of work to be done in this course, but that is not indifferent from every other sophomore economic tutorial, and this course deals with a topi that is not only highly interesting, but that is applicable to all areas of life, making it much more understandable and easier to learn about.","Best course I've taken at Harvard. You should definitely take the History of Economic Thought. I learned so much and David is great (but I don't think he'll be back).","I really enjoyed my tutorial, \"The Economics of Poverty\" taught by Nico Grosman. The course was well organized and structured, providing a great overview of poverty in the context of development economics. Nico really knew his economic models and went through every academic paper rigorously to explain the models. I also loved reading the leading literature on the topic.","Economics of National Security is a very interesting course. Jessica is very knowledgable and class discussions were always informative. Many assignments throughout but all enjoyable.","Lots of writing, but the topics are usually pretty interesting.","Take it! The material is really interesting and really important. You won't regret taking this class.","It is necessary to take this course for future econ classes as it prepares one to write proper econ papers and also learn how to find sources and information outside of the readings","Hillel is a great teacher and a really good guy. You can tell he really cares about his students. I would definitely recommend this tutorial.","Make sure to take a tutorial on a topic you find (or think you will find) interesting","Be prepared to work","Be prepared to do a lot of assignments that might take you out of your comfort zone and to do A LOT of reading.","If Rajiv Shankar is teaching the course...don't take it.","If you're not sure you want to go into banking, this will probably help you in making a decision.  If you're really interested in doing research, though, (say, for a thesis), I would recommend doing a more research oriented tutorial, as this is more practical.  The work gets brutal sometimes, especially towards the end, but I am pretty sure everyone comes out in the end glad they did it, which is what happened to me.  If your classes to this point had been average classes in terms of amount of work, be ready to work very very hard, and factor in some sleepless nights for the last couple of weeks for the assignments.  To make up for it, I found the material very very interesting and feel so much more prepared to enter the professional world.  It's probably the most practical class you can take at Harvard if you're at all interested in finance.  Vladimir is a truly awesome guy.  He truly cares about the material and it shows.  He also really cares about the students in the class and goes above and beyond to interact with us.  I really appreciated being in his class. Overall, it was a positive experience.  Through it, especially when working on models, it got to some very difficult points of independent work, but in the end all worked out and I am glad I did.","If you're interested in law, take the contract law class! Really interesting, and Yonatan is great.","It was interesting material and good interactive class, but disorganized and deadlines kept switching around so it got confusing\/hectic towards the end.","If you have any interest in finance try your best to take this course, it will be your favorite at Harvard.","I think that sophomore tutorials are pretty unstructured in general. You can learn a lot, but it's really about how much you put into the class.","The Political Economy of China Course with Daniel was really great. It required a ton of work and a very large amount of writing, but was very much worth it. Every class was discussion based and allows you to engage well in the small setting. It is very difficult however and the readings can get dense.","Jessica Blankshain is a fantastic teacher who's passionate about the material she's teaching and enjoys working with students.  Take it with her if you can!","Law and Economics was an awesome course. Provides a great base for knowledge of the legal system while challenging your intuition and involving economics. Hillel was an unbelievable section leader, no awkward silences, always a counter example to consider, very easy to converse with, interesting stories and applicable precedents, and an all around welcoming atmosphere.","Political Economy of China was fantastic!  I knew nothing about China going into the course, and felt that I had a grasp on the inner workings of the Chinese economy and state by the end.  Daniel is an awesome TF and a great person in general, a combination that is sometimes pretty tough to find.  He was very invested in our success and is passionate about what he does.","EC970 can be painful and NOT FUN but this section was very good.","If you are interested in law or are deciding if law school is right for you, this class will give you the answer.","Interesting course, but you could learn the same by reading a textbook or the readings for the course.","Do all the readings! It's definitely worth it to participate in class, you'll learn so much. Smaller class sizes make a huge difference.","Awesome class for any econ concentrator thinking about becoming a lawyer","Vladimir is great; best course I have taken at Harvard. I really enjoyed; it was a lot of work too. Make sure to stay on top of everything.","Rajiv really pushes you to produce really impressive work\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit's tough and a ridiculous amount of work, but in the end it's a great experience.","Section TF entirely determines how good your experience is. National security with Jessica was great, but I heard someone new is teaching it next year.","Having econometrics under my belt made the analysis, writing, and final paper much easier and better.","Read and Write.","Jessica Blankshain's Economics of National Security is awesome. She truly generates enthusiasm for the material, which covers a wide range of topics related to defense policy, budgeting, interactions within the armed forces, military conflicts, etc. A great overview, but maybe a little disjointed because of the variety of topics addressed; I didn't really feel like there was much cohesion. That said, I think the span of the course's topics, and the fact that national security isn't considered a strictly 'economic' topic, demonstrated the breadth of economic analyses that can be applied to a multifacted field like national security.","Very great for those interested in law and shows you a different way of looking at the legal process.","always do your reading, and prepare for your final paper early.","You can tell that Daniel is very intrigued with China and the issues that they are currently facing. The topics that we go through are very interesting but sometimes the reading is a little too long and becomes difficult to understand because of the complicated models involved.","This was my favorite class I've taken at harvard so far. The small discussion setting was perfect for me to interact with the TF and other students in a meaningful and engaging manner.","I learned a lot about the economics of attention and what consumers are responsive to and what they are not. Very useful in a business sense.","Roy is a great TF! He really engages in the discussion and provides good feedback on assignments. If you are interested in cultural economics or psychology and economics, this is definitely the tutorial to take!","Really interesting, a lot of readings but you'll learn a lot","Make sure you do the readings and come to class ready to articulate your position on whatever issue is being discussed. Also start writing the various papers on time. You will get a lot from this class.","Like all tutorials, your experience totally depends on who your section leader is. I had the fortune to have a tutorial that I liked and a tutorial leader who was supportive and gave fair assignments. Also, learning about poverty and inequality in the US is interesting!","It is extremely demanding at times, but I am hard pressed to think of any course I have taken here in which I retained as much useful info and actually learned some skills (modeling).","If you choose a Quant Level 3 tutorial, be prepared to spend a lot of time trying to make sense of the math. Otherwise, the class is well-taught and makes you analyze economic papers with a critical eye.","you need to put in the time.","Excellent material, freedom to do what you want on papers is nice. You need to be able to deal with uncertainty in grading\/assignments."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Take econometrics, or another class that teaches you regression analysis.","This class is an awesome way to explore development economics. It is challenging but also fun to do your own research","I think the experience varies completely from one tutorial to the next. If you get a great one, it will be a fantastic learning experience. I was with Natalie Bau in the Education Economics tutorial and I loved it. I don't think I've learned this much from any other class I've taken -- in terms of knowledge base but also experience doing research and writing a research paper. It will be hard to be sure but ask around to find out about TFs, because it will make a huge difference!","It is important to not only find a section that is interesting, but also one that you know you can handle the difficulty of the readings or else you wont be able to participate much in section discussion.","This is a very good sophomore tutorial; you'll come away from the class with a much better understanding of poverty and inequality in the US (as advertised).  Dr. Juras is extremely helpful and friendly.  The empirical assignment is difficult, but doable.","Great class on applied corporate finance. Vlad is a wonderful teacher and will do whatever he can to help you understand and apply the material. The class also has great supplemental materials that will help you learn. However, this class requires significant time investment and would not recommend taking unless you are very interested in the topic.","Can give you an in depth look at some aspect of economics that you're interested in, in a smaller setting where you read and discuss the papers","Yonatan is an excellent teacher and mentor. The work required is reasonable; at times it is challenging, but at times not too demanding. The assignments do a good job of effectively synthesizing the learning you have done during the semester. Definitely my favorite course I took this semester.","Great course. Duncan is awesome.","If you have the opportunity, take Randall Juras' class. He's an incredibly smart guy and knows everything about the topic. He facilitates discussion effectively and assigns readings and assignments that further your knowledge. Plus he gives you amazing feedback on all of your work. My favorite class at Harvard so far.","The poverty related classes are the best and most interesting. You'll actually enjoy the readings and research. Also the TFs are just cooler and nicer.","Tutorial is a lot of work but you learn a lot too.  It is a good introduction to reading economic papers and conducting your own research.  Health care economics felt like an especially relevant topic.","Pick a class based on your quant level, otherwise it can be difficult. But the small class means you learn a lot!","I took an Econ sophomore tutorial as an elective, which I highly recommend as long as you can get a section you want. I was in Institutional Investing with Kyle - not sure if it'll be offered again, but it's the perfect class for someone who has any level of knowledge about finance and wants an overview of the field. It was definitely challenging, but in the right ways (limited busy work, and only the assignments that require actual ability were difficult). Overall, what'll make or break your tutorial are the people in your class and your TF - if you don't like either at the beginning, consider switching or dropping it.","Roy is an excellent teacher. He really cares about his students. Just be prepared for some tough feedback and a lot of reading and writing. Unlike other tutorials where the work can be very heavy towards the end of the semester, Roy does a great job of spreading it out. If you like receiving feedback throughout the semester this is the course for you. Disclaimer it is less about law and more about behavioral economics.","Make sure to pick something your interested in. You have to do a lot of research and write very long papers on the topic.","If you have conflicting feelings about law, take this class. It greatly piqued my interest in law.","Pick a research topic that really interests you.","Rajiv was a bit of a bully. So you may want to take this class once he isn't teaching","Global Games was an interesting class, but we didn't receive very helpful feedback on assignments. I learned game theory, but probably not as much as I could have... I think that sophomore tutorials are a chance to explore a topic closely within economics, but choose wisely.","Great course. You get to see what real economists do when they're not writing textbooks, and take a stab at doing some of it yourself. This is the first ec course I had where I saw how useful what I had already learned in the concentration can be.","Obviously the tutorials vary in topics, but if you find one like \"Modeling Wars with Game Theory,\" that means you've found a course combining economics, math, and modeling with a readily applied real-world idea (often viewed as foreign from economic analysis). My tutorial wasn't too burdensome (although the final paper took some time), and the assignments were helpful in building up to it. A really cool semester.","Take Marek's course. It is a great economic overview and never gets boring.","necessary class, fun","If you have any interest in financial markets, you should take this class","Natalie is great. This is a great introduction to education economics and will put you in a great position when it comes to thinking about thesis topics.","The M&A Class with Vlad is without doubt the best class I have taken at Harvard. I've learned so much about various topics in finance. It's a lot of work but 100% worth it. Also, Vlad is the best teacher at Harvard. He truly cares about every student and makes an effort to get to know him\/her. Definitely rank this class first if you are interested in finance.","You will really enjoy learning about the energy industry and the topics, which span the entire industry from upstream to downstream. I highly recommend this tutorial since you will learn a lot from it and enjoy doing the assignments for this class.  It is a great way to fulfill your Econ tutorial.","This course has a high expectation level for the work you put out, but the knowledge gained is very practical and insightful.","I was in Vlad's section and I just want to say that if you do get a chance to take the M&A tutorial, only take it if you're interested in finance\/consulting -- it's a lot of rigorous work, but it definitely pays off later on. The class is geared toward who want to go into the industry, and while there is a lot of new changes in the class that cover stata and economic understanding of the financial space, it definitely still has additional components of the class that you won't learn in any other class (ie excel modelling). Highly recommended.","Depends on the topic you choose but psych & ec is so interesting and definitely least research based in terms of statistical analysis","This tutorial (Energy Industry Economics and Policy) is the best class that I have taken at Harvard to date. Tutorial teaches you to apply the concepts learned in Ec10\/Ec1010 to real-world issues, and cements your understanding of economics in general.","Lots of reading. Some knowledge of econometrics is required even though many courses say that you don't need it. You will learn a lot, but it's not an easy process by any means.","It requires a lot of self-motivation and interest in the topic. It can be VERY enjoyable if you embrace what you are learning and the work load, but I think that people who are not necessarily passionate about this and similar topics will have a hard time.","Great course-- very interesting for people with varying interests. Roy will offer challenging viewpoints on your papers, but it is ultimately helpful and teaches you to think in new ways.","Kyle is an interesting, enthusiastic teacher and makes class and the subject matter very entertaining.","Best class I have ever taken","\"Why is Africa Poor\" is a phenomenal economics tutorial and I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the topic. However, I would also recommend at least some background work in Econometrics.","Your tutorial experience almost entirely depends on who your section leader is. My section leaders, Heather and John were the best, but sadly, they'll be leaving. Look for a tutorial topic that really interests you, or it's gonna suck to spend all that time on a class you don't really like.","Do all the readings, there are a lot, but they are interesting.","Challenging course but manageable if you are well organized and have a true passion for corporate finance. Highly recommend if you can see yourself going the finance route after college. One of the best classes I have taken at Harvard","You're surprised at what you've accomplished at the end of this class. Those papers are tough.","This course does an excellent job of giving students exposure to applied corporate finance from an academic viewpoint. Take the tutorial taught by Vladimir. It will be the best class you'll take at Harvard by a mile.\r\n\r\nI followed the oil and gas industry throughout the semester and got exposure to several other financial industries as well. All the assignments in the class are extremely rewarding. The final essay allows you to use STATA\/R and write a research paper focusing on M&A in a financial industry of your choice.\r\n\r\nIt's the perfect course. Just take it. And make sure you are NOT taking anymore than 4 classes with it, if you are in Vlad's section. His class is awesome, but requires you to put in a lot of effort, really. Be ready to give it your all towards the end of the semester. Everything you do in this class will be very rewarding though.","Great class for an overall introduction to some of the most pressing issues in the financial industry.","If you don't know which tutorial to take, definitely take this one! I found behavioral economics extremely interesting because it is the only part of economics that assumes people are not rational actors. The readings are applicable to everyday life--procrastination and self-control problems.","Ec 970, \"Contemporary Debates in Development Economics\" led by Kiran Gajwani is hands-down the BEST economics course I have taken so far! If you are at all interested in development studies, this is the course to take! Kiran leads you through some of the most interesting, nuanced topics in development -- causes of underdevelopment, decentralization as a tool for development, political reservations for women, conditional cash transfer programs, debt relief, foreign aid, food aid, and randomized experiments. Every reading, every class, every discussion leads to surprising insights and aspects of development economics you will never have thought about before. The class is certainly rigorous -- the assignments come quickly near the end, and the level of STATA \/ econometrics required is demanding. But you learn SO much, and by the end you are very well equipped to conduct your own empirical research in development. Take this class!!!","Choose a topic that interests you and you cannot go wrong. Seriously, in the end, how much you enjoy the course is up to you.","The Nobel Prize class was great! Interesting readings, covered a wide range of economic ideas and theories, and great discussions. Marek is also very helpful, especially when it's time to write the final paper. Definitely take this tutorial if you get the chance.","Do not take this class unless you are interested in energy\/sustainability.  There is a lot of work and if you are not interested in the topic will not enjoy it at all.","Difficult","The value is in the reading.","Professor Neugeboren's feedback was extremely helpful for the papers.","Take this course even if you are not an Econ concentrator. It really teaches you how to engage with research articles and how to organize and conduct experiments. It's also mostly a DIY kind of course.","This is a relatively chill tutorial that does not require as much work as other ones. We only had to read 4-5 papers every week, and the writing assignments are relatively simple (2-3 pages for short assignments).Sophia is extremely nice and helpful, and we play a lot of games during class, which makes it quite fun. Note that this tutorial is very focused on experimental design and theoretical aspect of economic games, so you might like it if you like designing your own experiments.","Kyle Welch is an awesome TF.","Of all the tutorials, I think this one is one of the best. You get out what you put in to it. Do the readings and ask questions. Professor N is extremely knowledgeable and really will work with you so you understand the concepts.","Unfortunately many of these tutorials are scheduled during athletics practice times, so I was very restricted on what to choose.  As a result, I was placed into a tutorial that I wasn't interested in.  It was an ok class, and a requirement, so you can't really do anything about it. But if possible, really make sure you take a topic that you like.","The preceptor is very strict and very harsh on grading otherwise the course is really great and it is probably the best class you will ever take at Harvard. Kiran is amazing.","Fantastic.","I took the \"Providing for the sick\" Health Care Economics Tutorial with Duncan Gilchrist, and it was so interesting. Talking with other tutorial students, others enjoyed their tutorials as well, but not as much as I enjoyed mine. If this topic interests you, this is a phenomenal course, covering at great breadth and depth many different topics in the health economics field. My only issue and surprise was how econometrics based it was. I didn't take metrics and didn't know much about metrics going in and it made the course substantially harder. You are asked to do a final project conducting your own research, which was tough because I didn't have any metrics knowledge. But Duncan helped me through it. Overall, the course was phenomenal and I loved it. Highly recommend it.","Keep up with the readings! Also Ovul is very receptive to feedback and will support you in everything you need, so don't be afraid to reach out!","The readings were occasionally boring, but you get out of the class what you put into the discussions.","This course has many of the same problems that plague Expos 20: a weird sectioning algorithm that randomly puts you in a section that is not necessarily suited for you, high variability between sections and TFs that could make or break your experience, and a large lack of oversight or can about the course to enact any changes from year to year. Because there are so many factors in Ec970 that can affect a student's experience, oftentimes Q guide reviews are not heeded since it could just be a couple whiners in certain sections. Overall, the course is not terrible, but it could stand to use a lot more improvement. It is a requirement for Ec concentrators, so you might as well settle into the course.\r\n\r\nI would recommend finding upperclassmen and polling their opinions on their specific tutorials and instructors (instructors really make it break it here). Once you hear about a good one, even if it is not a great topic, do it. It is so much more worth it than taking a tutorial from an unknown in a field that you do like - in my opinion there are lots of bad apple instructors so you do not really want to take the risk.\r\n\r\nTake econometrics before you take this course. It will save your butt over and over again.","If you can get in Kyle Welch's section, and you are interested in investment, go for it. The class is very fair and interesting, and Kyle is a great section leader.","It's an awesome class with an awesome teacher, with a very recent topic so it's interesting","Bryce is an amazing TF--best I've had in a while. But, do have a real interest in the material. This was my 6th choice so going through readings was tougher, but Bryce was better than I could have imagined at keeping us engaged in an open and friendly class","This class requires a lot of work but the time and effort will be worth it. Vladimir is the most caring and knowledgeable professor I have met at Harvard, and he really cares about his students. If you are interested learning a lot and getting high returns for your input, then take his class.","Heavy work load at times but you learn a lot. Vlad is a great teacher.","You will be challenged to the point where you're not sure you can do it, but you'll learn a lot and Kiran really knows what she's talking about. Be prepared to work the hardest you've ever worked.","This is a great class, especially if you take a tutorial about a subject you find interesting. I took the behavioral ec and applications tutorial..it was challenging but it in a fair and useful way. The term paper was a lot of work, but you felt satisfied after completing it.","The teacher is uncaring, and the assignments were unclear.","I took Supplying the Sick. The class is a good introduction to different types of economics classes. Discussions during class were really helpful for learning how to read papers critically. If you find the topic of your tutorial interesting, the class itself will be enjoyable.","Good course in which to discuss the econometrics behind healthcare. Awesome TF who's really willing to help you understand the concepts!","As long as it is not taught by Rajiv, game theory is a really cool topic and it is relevant to so many things. The course was structured terribly- we learned the specifics of game theory and then read a bunch of papers, with a different topic for each class, but we did not learn much. David Johnson was a sub for a week and we talked about game theory in the context of today's society and I learned so much more than I had all semester. I don't want to say it's a bad class because the topic is great. Rajiv was the kind of teacher that puts you down instead of helping you learn, and that made class very difficult. Hopefully it will be restructured and taught by someone else.","This is a fascinating topic in which to take a class, and the class does a good job teaching how to write an economics paper, which is an important skill in the department.","If you want a good introduction to the world of portfolio management, this is a great class to take. A combination of readings with Kyle's expertise in the area will give you both the rudimentary know-how of the topic and in depth debates behind each.","The Economics of Contract Laws tutorial taught by Yonatan was amazing. Not sure if he's teaching it again next year, but if he is I highly recommend this section. Anyone who's interested in law schools but have very little knowledge of what it's like should take this course- it obviously does not reflect what law school's like comprehensively, but it definitely gives you a taste of it.","This class will certainly give you a different angle on financial markets and the market for corporate control. You will not only immerse yourself in the practical nature of the field, but also dive into regression analysis in the final research paper. Sections flow very well and it is easy to follow every step of the way. A very fun class.","It will be really interesting if you get lotteried into one of the top choices you get (which most students, including me, did). Try to participate in the discussions will be nice. Some papers include difficult math theories, but it is not required to really know them. I really like mine (National Security). The format of the class is to go through the economic papers we read for HW and have discussions.","Great course! It is very interesting putting words to empirical regressions, and vice versa.","This is a review for Kyle Welch's Institutional Investing course. I think you will get much more out of this course if you don't already have a substantial knowledge of finance. Start the empirical assignments and final papers early, and make sure you fully understand the readings before each class. Class discussions were very stimulating and students were allowed to discuss the topics they found most interesting.","Class is very interesting for those curious about the financial crisis or finance in general, especially with the past few decades. Should have some prior knowledge of finance before entering. Some readings are technical or very finance-specific, but you if you put in effort you will get a lot from the course. Dorian is very nice, flexible and knowledgeable having worked in finance for decades.","I think this is the last year it is being taught, but Nico did an amazing job selecting both assignments and readings to introduce us to development economics and teaching us how to critique and eventually write our own research papers.","fantastic tutorial","For a departmental requirement, this is a pretty good class. That said, quality really varies based on your section. I took Plamen's section and quite liked it. There is a substantial amount of reading and a surprising amount of written work, so I would avoid his class unless you are really interested in the subject. But, if you are passionate about the material, go for it!","I took this without any econometrics background and the readings were mostly over my head. I think if I had the econometrics I would have enjoyed the class more","This class is rewarding and fun especially for students who think they want to study economics beyond the undergraduate level.","This was the most educational experience I've had so far at Harvard - the small class setting and the depth of the material being taught made the course extremely engaging. It was definitely a great learning experience and I feel great coming out of the course, because I feel that I've learned so much.","wonderful class. Randall is so kind and intelligent and makes the class very enjoyable. you will also learn a lot, especially if you would like to attend grad school in economics","Dorian Klein's class on the financial crisis was fantastic.  I probably learned most in this class out of all the classes I've taken at Harvard.  It's a lot of work but definitely worth it!","I think that class was really fun. It was Anastassia's first time teaching it and I think that its going to be best sophomore tutorial after this initial test run. Not that it wasn't awesome this time, its just that some of the readings were a little difficult to understand. Those have either been taken out or changed.","Take Vlad's class. It is a phenomenal class - you will work extremely hard but you will learn and research the economics behind finance.","It is good if you are interested in corporate governance.","Duncan was a great teacher. He leads really interesting discussions and he is brilliant. The class is very challenging but you learn how to really critique and create real economic research","I recommend this class! Natalie was a fantastic teacher. It seems like she knows everything about the material. She always involved the class. We had some great discussion in class. It was fun to be able to apply what I had learned in other econ classes to real life. Be sure you've taken (or are taking) 1123 when you take this class!","Get ready to do a ton of work, but so so so worth it","Institutional Investing with Kyle Welch is a FANTASTIC course. Kyle is super chill but literally a finance genius. The class requires a lot of reading and work but it's totally worth it, especially if you're interested in asset management. This is the first class at Harvard that I've taken that I feel will actually be useful to my life after college. Wall Street here I come","There's better ways to learn about game theory in international politics","Best course I have taken at Harvard. I think being interested in law (not necessarily well-versed) made it a lot more fun. Other than that, if you are scared of a tutorial with a lot of econometrics....this might be the one for you! But really, no, you should take it because Yonatan is great, not because you are scared of econometrics. That he takes time to impart wisdom onto a select group of sophomores is a gift....avail yourself of it!","I took Energy Economics with Howell. The class was great, but very time consuming. There is a lot of reading, so make sure you are actually interested in the course material. Sabrina gave us lots of feedback, which made it easier to write the dreaded final paper (get started on that ASAP). If you're an ec major you have to take the class, so just pick one you think you would like and get on with it.","It is very useful and very interesting. I enjoyed going to class and engaging in discussions. I usually hate talking in section, but this class was completely different. I actually enjoyed speaking up often.","Vlad is an awesome teacher who knows so much about investment banking and the financial industry. The assignments in the class will require you to put in a lot of time and practice paying attention to details, but you will undoubtly come out of the class more prepared if you want to go into finance. Highly recommended, there are both theoretical\/reading parts of the class discussion as well as applicable work. Lottery for your tutorial, you won't regret it.","This is an amazing course. Heather and John are awesome TFs. Hope your TF's are as good haha","I mean, it's required. Choose a good section! Mine was Psychology & Economics and I heard it was  the most chill 970 tutorial. The material was interesting and the TF Ovul Sezer was amazing.","This course will prepare you to think independently as an economist.","Don't shy away from this class because of its workload and intensity. If you want to go into finance this class is a MUST, and even if you don't, it is amazing knowledge to take into the world.","Find a topic that you're interested in","The only reason you take this class is because it's required. It has the potential to be special, but the execution left something to be desired.","This course is a good introduction to inferential preferences but can get slightly repetitive because the department has forced the behavioral economics courses to specialize. None of the offer a complete overview of the developing field.","Laws Markets and Morals was a great class --- interesting topic and moderate work load.","For Nobel Prize-Winning Contributions to Economics: Excellent tutorial. Marek is awesome and I really enjoyed every single class. The reading were interesting and the class discussion was really useful. I think this is a great overview for any ec concentrator. While I don't know all the different topics in great detail, it was really important for me to understand how the field of economics has evolved in the last century. Really interesting stuff and Marek is a great teacher.","This tutorial really brought my understanding of economics to a new level. The theoretical classes (Ec 10, 1010) are important for building economic foundations, but this course (the economics of health and education) helped me synthesize all I had learned and apply it to our world. Bryce was a really awesome teacher who challenged us while still guiding us through the semester. In discussing health and education (especially in the developing world), I was able to use the tools learned in Econometrics to ultimately examine a topic that directly affected me (the effect of summer length on test scores) in my final research paper. This research paper provided a very real glimpse into the world of economic research, and was a really satisfying project. The sophomore tutorial is where concentrators really become economic students, and you should expect to spend 10+ hours a week on readings, response papers and research. It is highly advised that students have either taken, or are co-enrolled in economics 1123, and have taken Ec 10 and 1010. Overall, a really great class. You will learn a lot, but you should be prepared to work hard.","This course is great, especially compared to some of the other reviews Ive heard about other tutorials. The reading is interesting and not overwhelming, and you get to play games in class! Definitely take this course. Mr. Neugeboren is fantastic.","A lot of reading, but worth it","This class is great. Kyle is a great instructor and I would definitely say take this class. The readings are great too and very useful for your future. Final paper is a lot of work, though if you pick a topic that interests you, you will enjoy it and learn a lot. Take this class.","Most interesting undergrad econ course I have taken thus far.","Treat each paper as a gift from Yaron. It is your prerogative to closely examine the materials.","First, don't try to pick an \"easy\" section.  They all have similar work, readings, grading, etc. Pick something you're legitimately interested in.  You'll get the most out of it and perform the best in this way.  Do the readings, think critically about them, and participate in the discussion.  If you do these three things, the class can be an awesome experience.","A ton of work, but definitely worth it"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["The Economics of Education section of Econ 970 was nothing like I expected. It was dry, and possibly one of the worst choices I could make.","While I may be biased since I do not know about other Economics tutorials, I think this is one of the very best tutorials you can take. I gathered this from my friends in other tutorials who were less that enthusiastic about those tutorials","Very interesting stuff and awesome teachers.","This tutorial gives a pretty solid introduction to both the theory and practice of finance, by looking at the theoretical literature on why banks and other financial institutions exist, and then taking a detailed look both at the financial crisis and at financial sector policy. The material can be math-heavy and Divya is not always successful at getting a lively discussion going, but overall a good class.","Contract Law with Yonathan Arbel was a great class. Discussions were always engaging and the workload was reasonable. My favorite economics class after two years.","This was great class, with very interesting material, and the TF Roy is one the best teachers at Harvard.","This was really one of my favorite classes at Harvard.  It really was a change from all of the other classes and even though I have attend other small section classes before, this was definitely a completely different experience.  Yonathan is a brilliant teacher and really taught us not only about contract law, but about how to think in a completely new way.  This class fully embodies Harvard's goal to teach others how to think critically, especially about small transactions and everyday interactions that we usually ignore.  Really, I recommend anyone who is remotely interested in law and business, or might have used to be, to take this class.  This description does not begin to touch on how much we have learned and I am so glad to have been placed into this course.","Great course with very knowledgable instructor, but the course can also be very challenging.","This class is mandatory if you are an economics concentrator. Go for a good TF; the TF matters 100000X more than the course material.","Marek Hlavac's course on Nobel Prize Winning Contributions to Economics is an excellent choice for your sophomore tutorial. Interesting readings and a great teacher - you won't be disappointed.","Take this course if you have the slightest interest in development or development policy. I learned a lot and it was very interesting, but be prepared to do a lot of reading and writing. This tutorial was also very specific to Latin America, so keep that in mind.","Only take if you are an Ec Concentrator.","Neugeboren is a champion.  I thought I was going to hate this tutorial, but he actually made it interesting.","Be ready to read a lot.","Yonathan is very well versed in the economics implications of legal theory. Readings can be very dense, and almost impossible to understand without a basic foundation in legal theory, but the economic insights can be very interesting.","Evan's tutorial on monetary policy is awesome! I learned so much about the inner workings of the Fed, financial crises, and the course is very relevant to other courses like Ec 1010. You'll also discuss the news every week so you're not completely ignorant of important current events.","Be prepared for a lot of silence during class.","I learned a lot about poverty and income inequality through this course and Randall really encouraged discussion within the class. Even though this course wasn't my top choice, I thoroughly enjoyed the material and lecture and really came out of the class a better Economist. Randall is an amazing teacher who really cares about his students learning and I really recommend this course. 10\/10.","It is incredibly important who the instructor is. Think very carefully when you decide which tutorial classes you rank.","This course will allow to you see many aspects of your life and of family life differently!","Akos Lada's course, The Political Economy of International Conflict, was a solid course. He was a very enthusiastic section leader, and I feel that I learned a lot about game theory and international relations. However, the class could be slow\/dry at times. I would only choose this section if you know for sure that you are very interested in international relations.","If you can get Jane's fertility tutorial section, I would take it. Readings are very fair, so you can actually do them all every week without too much stress. She really knows what she is doing and is going to be teaching the STATA component next year, which is a help because she really knows how to use STATA which you need. She also responds to emails promptly and provides tons of feedback for your final project which makes sure you are on the right track.","The sophomore tutorial was a really enjoyable experience, and I think I wrote my best paper in college so far. If you are an Economics concentrator you will have to take it, so you might as well have fun with it! Pick something interesting, maybe go in already with a research paper idea. It will make everything very focused and enjoyable. :)","You will learn a lot in this class but it also falls on you to emphasize what you want to focus on. The professor is very knowledgeable and accessible. He brings up many different views and you will need to sort through those opinions. However, it was a great class and I enjoyed it a lot. Do take it if you want to learn more about finance.","GET RANDALL AS A T.F.!!!! If he is still teaching the course. He is hands down one of the best T.F.s for an economics tutorial - he is always available to help, great at explaining things, and overall a down-to-earth and approachable person.","Yonathan Arbel is a great instructor who really utilizes the socratic method during section. Most interesting section leader I've had in terms of life stories and teaching methods. Good sense of humor and I would highly recommend this class.","This class is incredible. Yaron is extremely nice, helpful, and knows so much about corporate governance and financial institutions.","Economics and Psychology was the best tutorial no doubt.  Ovul is the most kind and understanding preceptor.  She is extremely intelligent and facilitated great conversations.  The atmosphere of our section was wonderful, and the material was both interesting and manageable.  It was such a great experience.","Roy Shapira is awesome. he is ver y knowledgable and made section interesting. he can explain any topic to make it understandable to everyone","Anne is an excellent section leader. She knows a ton about the subject matter, and is passionate about it to boot. She's a patient teacher and always makes herself available to help out or answer questions via email or in office hours.","Interesting material - be prepared to spend a lot of time learning\/understanding Stata and its application to the course","Evan is a great TF.  This course forces you to keep up with current events and allows you to think about current events through a historical economic perspective, particularly in respect to the Fed.  Some points at the beginning of the semester are dry, but you end with an engaging unit on the great recession.  The final paper is also very open ended.","This class is annoying because it has to be built around the requirements that are made by the ec department where it feels like had our teacher been allowed to do whatever she wanted it would have been incredible. That said, pick something you like. Professor Saka's Art Markets class was really good. Also take ownership over the class. If the presentations suck, address it early. If you only go over things that you read and it's boring, you have the power to change that. Our class realized this too late and wanted the professor to do something or the structure to change, but we could have done something about it, too.","i really don't want to tell you anything, it was a solid class","Amazing tutorial!!! If you are interested in nonprofits, definitely consider this option. Erez and Mosche are fantastic, you learn a lot, and they are very reasonable!","Meetings are good, but the stata part of the class is done very poorly.","Yaron is an extraordinary professor. His deep understanding of corporate law and corporate finance is evident every single day. He has a very flexible and well-structured approach: we read relevant theoretical and empirical papers and then engage in open discussion. He is charismatic and engaging. The assignments are interesting and fun to do, with much flexibility to do take your own approach. Definitely recommend this particular tutorial if you're interested in corporate governance, finance, equity markets, and board dynamics - and an incredible instructor.","This is an absolutely amazing course, and I thoroughly believe it could be the best class I take at Harvard. Evan is super chill and actually makes the class fun and interesting. I'd say that compared to my other friends' tutorials, Evan's is less work intensive but actually super enjoyable. Additionally, most of the readings are actually interesting, and all response papers and essays are super flexible, so you can write about what interests you. I would recommend this class for anyone that is interested in both politics\/policy and economics. Overall, great class, take it take it take it.","Well taught, fun, interesting, and great discussion, making it easier to learn the material and illustrate your knowledge","Evan is very understanding, reasonable, and down-to-earth, and is easy to get along with. The readings for the course are interesting, but the structure of daily classes gets a bit stale after a while. If you are looking for a tutorial with a more analytically heavy bent, do not take this one. If, however, you are looking for a good, theoretical analysis of the Fed and its inner workings, this is a great class to take.","Ec 970 is one of my favorite classes that I've taken at Harvard so far. Art and Economics with Gizem Saka was awesome. She was really nice and was a fair grader when it came to essays. Class discussions were open and fun. Overall work level is manageable, but be sure to find a term paper topic that interests you!","EC970 is a lot of time, but it's hands down been the best experience I've had at Harvard, and I feel much more comfortable within the department (despite its large size) as a result.","Really depends on what topic you get and your TF.","Taking Monetary Policy Tutorial.  Its the best one","The section component to this glad was great, my TF was awesome and from what I've heard most of the TF's were awesome\r\n\r\nBut I would rather chug a two liter bottle of Sriracha than have to do one of the Stata psets again","I really enjoyed this class. I went into my section a bit nervous, as it discussed finance and required taking Math 21a. Although I didn't really know much about the topic, I found that reading the papers carefully and trying to participate in class discussion was incredibly helpful, and I found I learned more in this class than any other I've taken. By the time we came around to the final paper, I felt that I was well prepared and was actually excited to write an academic paper. I was proud of it when it was finished, and overall look back on the class well. Although this could be looked at as just another requirement for the Economics department, if you find a topic that you really enjoy, you'll have a great experience. The only thing that wasn't fun was the Stata section of the course, but there are only 4 problem sets.","The course is very interesting, but the material is long and repetitive. I would recommend this course for immigrants themselves or people who come from major immigration cities (Miami, San Diego, LA).","I would definitely tell Ec concentrators to take \"Not Tonight, Honey.\" The subject matter is really interesting and lets you see econ in a whole new light, far beyond just money and interest rates, and the instructor is so helpful and makes the tutorial really enjoyable. One of my favorite classes at Harvard. You will learn a ton and have fun doing it-- strongly recommend!","This course is very difficult but well worth the extra strain.","Great class! Take it even if you have no background in law.","Great way to learn about behavioral economics! You'll get a deep dive into the forefront of research and Danial has great enthusiasm!","Be prepared to write an empirical paper using data if you choose Dr. Herr's section.","This is the ec tutorial to take! Rob is a very flexible and engaging instructor, and the subject matter (game theory) is so interesting in ways you don't even expect. You'll find yourself thinking of so many real world examples, in and out of class. Rob isn't too strict about completing all the readings, but staying on top of them anyway will make your papers MUCH easier to write. The prisoners dilemma tournament is a fun extra assignment. Take this course!","Yonathan is an incredible teacher.  His classes are very interesting and he teaches you a lot about contract law in an efficient manner.","Experience in this course depends on your instructor. The economics papers are helpful for understanding the format of economics research, but doing the research can be tough.","Roy is an amazing teacher and you will learn a lot about how the world works","I felt like this class was a really good example of \"you reap what you sow\" - if you put in the effort and do the readings, class discussions can be really intellectually stimulating and rewarding :) It's definitely not possible to wing your way through the section discussions based on a cursory glance at the readings.","Enjoy it.","This is a great class. Readings become more interesting as the term progresses. Assignments are fair and thought-provoking. It is good that the instructor has students keep up with current events, as they often relate to political economy.","It is a great tutorial, with a large amount of practical application. I am not interested in a career in investment banking, but I still enjoyed this and would recommend it to anyone with any interest in financial markets.","This course is so interesting and is such a nice break from the required theory classes. Applying what you've learned as an economics concentrator is such a fun experience. Definitely try to to not only pick a subject you're interested in but a teacher you think you'd get along well with. It's an intimate class by nature and you will have a lot of interaction on a more one-on-one basis.","Nobel Prize Contributions: Marek is a brilliant, engaging, funny instructor.  You will learn about the most interesting research in pretty much every field in Economics.  Take this course!","Participate! you get a lot more from the experience, and you get to spark interesting conversations in a small setting.","Ovul us a very good teacher and the material she chose got the class was very interesting. She is an enthusiastic teacher who makes sure participating in section is very easy.","Unless you have to take it, don't take it.","Understanding Altruism has been my favorite course at Harvard (out of the 24 I have taken).  It is extremely interesting, and I actually enjoyed doing the readings, discussing in class, and creating my own experiment at the end.","This class varies significantly in both course-load and difficulty between instructors. For my experience, it was a very difficult and work intensive but ultimately rewarding.","This class provides you with an opportunity to learn more about development and foreign aid.","The readings are long and complicated.","Section: discussions were really good and well structured\r\nStata: the problem sets were hard, but the skills were helpful and rewarding\r\nTerm Paper: not much direction was given on this, but it's a rewarding experience\r\nOther Assignments: these were really good in terms of engaging with the economics reading\r\nReading: a lot of it, but made for good discussion","Saka is a wonderful professor with exceedingly fair standards and very clear and complete knowledge of her field.","The topic of this class may seem unconventional, but that is one of its strengths. You'll have a chance to see how economics can be applied to a subject that you won't cover in any general economics class. Jane gives incredibly detailed feedback. I felt like this class helped me to improve as a writer. At the end, you have to write a research paper and use Stata for data analysis and it was extremely gratifying to do. Some of the other tutorials don't require you to do the data analysis with Stata, (they let you write a purely theory based paper), but I really felt like I got a lot out of the final paper for this class.","Very interesting, well-structured class. Will give you lots of knowledge  about diverse econonomic issues. Gonzalo is one of the best teachers I have ever had at Harvard. Very smart, motivating, and friendly person.","Economics of Climate Change was really a great course. The readings were, with a couple exceptions, super interesting and all together create an amazing foundation of the economic factors that go into climate change efforts, evaluations, goals, and policy. Sam is extremely helpful with assignments and tough but fair in his grading. The final paper for all 970 courses is daunting and perhaps could be changed in order to encourage students to really work hard on it and feel like they're being acknowledged for that work; as it is, the research paper is so separate from the rest of the course that it was hard to consider it as a focus. Overall, Economics of Climate Change was a really great course that made me more interested in environmental economics and really teaches you a lot about the field, which is new and exciting (it's really like Sam says at the beginning of the class, you will finish the end of the semester feeling like you know more about the economics of climate change than 99.9% of the population). Definitely recommended.","The class experience is based on the TF, I had a great TF, but others do not.","The class is graded rather harshly, and the readings are very difficult, but you will learn a lot and feel like an expert in all your other economics classes that discuss the financial crisis.","\"Nobel Prize-Winning Contributions to Economics\" (Marek Hlavac). It is a great class as far as teaching and subject matter go.","If you're interested in finance and the last crisis, definitely pick Dorian's section. I loved watching documentaries on the subject, but the material from this class opened my eyes to unbiased information and taught me a lot about CDOs, CDSs, derivatives, etc. Plus, Dorian is amazing. He is a fair grader and gives great feedback.","Great class overall. The material can be dry at times but this is one of the most useful and applicable options to macroeconomics and the real world.","If Gizem fixes the way she organized this course, it could be really great! The response papers take way too much time. 3000 words every week? No thanks. Also, learning from my professor not my peers would be nice.","Choose a tutorial you're interested in. I really like learning about education, so reading the papers were somewhat enjoyable. Start earlier on your research paper or it'll creep on you.","You'll be reading a lot of econ research papers","Natalie is wonderful.  This class was super low-stress, but i think that it really left an impact.  It was a really interesting subject.","Jane is just great, she really makes the course worthwhile. The material is also really interesting.","If you are interested in finance and especially the financial crisis this is a great course to take. Although it may seem challenging at times make sure to ask questions and speak with Divya about what is confusing you. Divya is very good about making the complicated ideas in the papers understandable. Also make sure that you are up to date on your multivariable calculus. In the beginning of the course you will read several very mathy papers. That being said if you work hard and dedicate the time you will learn a lot in this course.","The course focuses on growth diagnostics, an analytic approach to development that looks at different statistics but doesn't involve running regressions. You won't use Stata for the papers.","Ovul is awesome!!!!! The readings are also super interesting and this class teaches you a lot you wouldn't expect. Take it.","I really enjoyed how small the sections were that this tutorial met in. I found the projects and assignments useful and liked seeing all of the effort I put into this class culminate in a final paper. This class is hit or miss based off of you TF. My TF was great and really cared for us students. Choose a topic that you like and are interested in and passionate about. Check out the syllabi before you choose your section.","hard but rewarding","Interesting field within economics.","Understanding Altruism was an awesome tutorial! Erez and Moshe are great guys and know a ton about the field. The papers and discussions were really interesting, and made you apply economic principles you learned in earlier classes to new, unique problems. If you're interested in the intersection of economics, psychology, or biology, take this course!","This class has an incredible amount of work. The benefits do not outweigh the rewards of taking this class. Be sure to ask past students about the workload.","Take Economic Analysis of Contract Law with Yonathan Arbel! You won't regret it and he is awesome. Classes are very interesting and the writing assignments are short and sweet - get straight to the point.","This class had great readings and covered good ground regarding poverty\/inequality. Dr. Juras is super nice and has a good eye for proper form for economic papers\/ empirical papers.","I took the tutorial on the Political Economy of International Conflict and it was great! Easily one of the best (if not the best) classes I've taken at Harvard. Akos, the TF, was very friendly and helpful. The subject matter is really great if (like me) you're interested in game theory, international politics, military history, and the study of war. You get to read some really interesting papers, and you get to write a paper with your very own model!","Take it!","This tutorial is really informative, and is the perfect way to get a basic understanding of the field of behavioral economics. The topic is interesting, the teacher is engaging, and you're guaranteed to learn something new! It's a really fun and great class!","Dorian is great. I very much enjoyed going to his section, and importantly I did learn a lot. He is an expert in what he teaches and has a very good personality.","The class was awesome and weas extremely relavent to the real world. It is very managable and very interesting as well.","Choose a topic you are interested in -- however your experience may be variable depending on your TF. Anastassia was very good about giving feedback and leading discussions, and I enjoyed the tutorial; however, I feel like the course lacked synthesis\/understanding or real life applications that we would not have arrived at reading the papers on our own.","This course is more work than any other tutorial and is not well taught. While the material is interesting, if you have no psychology background, it will be extremely difficult.","Take a good look at readings lists and syllabuses before making your choices!","Great TF. Great Topic.  Take it.","Nobel-Prize Winning Contributions to Economics was wonderful. Marek is a really awesome section leader who is really helpful and approachable. For those who are not sure of their interests in economics, this course provides a wonderful overview. It is a lot of reading, but very worth it.","Definitely put Jane's Economics of Fertility as your top choice! Great instructor and super interesting topic!","This class is awesome and definitely worth your while.","It requires a lot of reading, but the reading is interesting for the most part. Be prepared to speak about current events at the beginning of every section."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["The class has a nice balance between social psychology and economics","Not the most exciting course, but you'll learn a lot and its required.","I really liked it. I think there's a lot of readings but Kiran is amazingly nice and patient.","Kiran is a remarkably engaging and passionate lecturer who is so wonderfully dedicated to the field of developmental economics. Just a note: this is an incredibly labor intensive course with difficult material and more assignments than comparable tutorials. Highly recommend taking this course after econometrics not concurrently, and only if you have a serious passion in going into the developmental economic field.","Dorian is the best instructor I've had at Harvard and nobody even comes close. His ultimate goal is to have every student come away with a better understanding of what really happened during the financial crisis, and along the way, you really learn how to write and think like an economist. He's incredible and I'd encourage everybody to sign up for his tutorial.","Learn from Dorian, he has been my favorite TF i have had at Harvard","It is requires a lot of reading but the material is very interesting and the assignments are not to difficult.","Dorian is an awesome teacher. Although a bit boring at times, he generates enthusiasm for the topic and really cares about his students and teaching. The class is probably a bit easier than a lot of the other tutorials, but also equally (if not more) interesting.","You learn a lot about how to think about economics and write well in the field.","It was a totally different take on economics, but I really enjoyed the subject.","This class was great but the Stata p-sets take a significant amount of time.","Take Ovul Sezer's course. She is an EXCELLENT instructor, a fair grader, super passionate about the class material, and very accessible & responsive to emails.","JANE IS A GEM!!! Oh My Gosh!! I can't even begin to describe how great and down to earth she is! She is so willing to help you if you struggle a bit ( and I struggled through it sometimes), but she is so understanding. But of course, you have to be willing to reach out to her. I'm glad I did :) :) :) Jane is the best part of this class. Also, her own research is extremely interesting!"]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["This course (spring 2015) was a fantastic sophomore tutorial to take\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe subject matter changes continuously every week, which means that if you find something boring, you only are stuck with it for a week\u00e2\u20ac\u201dif you like certain material, then you're free to pursue it later in the concentration. For someone who didn't feel like going into a specific economic field so quickly, this was the perfect balance. The readings are the real papers underlying everything we read in the core courses\u00e2\u20ac\u201decon 10, 1010\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand really give a better picture of the competing landscape of the economic debate. Unlike the core courses, which may lead you to think that every economist believes in pretty much the same thing, this course really demonstrates that economists can be quite polarizing. Marek did a great job providing a balance between competing ideas while facilitating discussion, and all-in-all, I didn't have any regrets taking this course.","Take it if you are interested in finance. It is very informative","Maxim is a fantastic seminar leader. He is highly knowledgable about Russian economics and politics, and has firsthand policy experience. It an interesting topic\/unique case study - transition from communism to capitalism. Reading can be very long and cumbersome, but it improves. Very fair grading.","An interest in finance is all you need to succeed in this class.","This class is difficult with a lot of reading and intense class discussions, but if you want to learn something from Econ tutorial it is a good one to take.","Sarika Ringwala's class on Corruption, Governance and Development was excellent, if a bit repetitive at times. She's a great teacher and the class is a very good introduction to development economics.","It really depends which section you get. I got \"Markets and the Environment\", which was fantastic for my academic interests. Rebecca is an awesome TF, and she helped walk us through the big final paper even as she gave us plenty of flexibility in the paper's topic. If you're an Ec concentrator, you obviously have to take this class, but it was nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be.","This class was tough and time-intensive but one of my favorite Ec classes here. We were a group of only 8 students and we had lively discussions during each session -- we became pretty close by the end of the course. With the Stata PSETs, weekly memos, reports, and papers, it's a lot -- it can be a quite overwhelming\/demanding at times -- but it's worth it because you come out of the class with a great background (in my case, as a student of Pascal and Betsy) of health care in America and why disputes exist, plus you have an opportunity to actually delve into a dataset and do your own analysis, which is helpful for later thesis\/ec research. Pascal and Betsy are an AWESOME power team and they are fantastic teachers with diverse perspectives! Overall, Ec970 is what I imagined Harvard courses to be like before I came here -- small, interactive, fun, and intellectual.","Try to do at least one reading per class meeting so discussion does not fade.","It is a great way to be exposed to a wide source of information on energy markets. You learn a lot. Rohit is really helpful when you have trouble with assignments and the assignments teach you a ton of info","Marek is great. Overall, I enjoyed the economics sophomore tutorial because it had a wide selection of courses to choose from and because of the small class size. More specifically to this class, I like the breadth of topics that we covered. Marek is very reasonable and funny.","The introductory session that introduced all the possible tutorials was somewhat confusing and hard to keep up with, but I ended up with a tutorial that I deeply deeply enjoyed. Be sure to pick a topic that you find enjoyable and interesting, hopefully led by an excellent tutorial leader. The Stata portion of the course seems bolted on, but is a useful skill to have (though admittedly I would have rather learned R, which I hear is a more widely used program).\r\n\r\nUltimately, I ended up having a great time in this course, learning some really fascinating things in the small seminar format, and the work load was extremely manageable. That said, you're probably required to take this course for the concentration, so what I say probably doesn't matter.","This was a decent class, with an inherently interesting topic and great coverage. On that note, the readings and some of Rohit's insights were the best takeaways; actual class discussion (and personal understanding) of the readings was limited by the occasionally extremely-technical paper, not all of which Rohit was able to fully explain.","This is a pretty easy sophomore tutorial. Ovul is great. If you are really interested in behavioral ec, this is a bit basic.","Ec 970 is a great opportunity to hone your knowledge in a specific economic area of your interest.","This is a great course that introduces you to corporate governance, hedge fund, and private equity. Besides reading about theories, you also engage with current events, have movie screenings, and participate in simulations. The class is pretty relaxed, but if you take it seriously, you will learn a lot.","Very interesting course that teaches about the role of hedge funds and private equity.","Be sure to read the syllabi of all the tutorials or else you might get one that appears interesting but actually turns out the opposite.","Vladimir's class was very intense and difficult. There was a lot of work, and I don't think the assignments or participation component were particularly fair, but at the end of the day, learning the things in that class were worth it, and I know this class will help me more than any other class at Harvard in the real world. For that, I am grateful and would recommend this class, although unfortunately it probably won't be offered in future years.","It is very great as long as your tutorial is something you are actually interested in.","Really interesting material with lots of applications, I would highly recommend the class to anyone who is curious about the topic and say that you get out of it what you put in.","I took Nobel Prize with Marek Hlavac. I don't know how else to put this: Marek is not a good teacher. He's very standoffish and is not receptive to questions from the group. He'd rather take thirty minutes of each class going through his facebook showing off pictures of his most recent vacations, and then quickly brush aside any questions we may have on the material because of \"lack of time\" while rudely checking his watch instead of listening to us talk. The rest of the group has talked about this amongst ourselves and we see it as a huge problem. He's just a rude person in general. All seven of us agree that we initially took this class because of how many times \"Nobel Prize by Marek\" was mentioned in previous cue reviews. Little did we know that this was only because Marek specifically tells his students to do this. It just inflates his section misleadingly. Overall: this class has been a pretty miserable experience, and I would not recommend it.","Definitely have a strong interest in economics and energy in particular.","Tons of work but worth it","This class is a lot of hard work, but it is worth every second you spend on it. You will learn a lot by the end of this class, much more than what you will expect. This will also put you at an advantage later in life, because this material is not usually offered to students at liberal arts college. If you get the chance to take this class. Consider yourself very lucky.","Neugeboren is a great professor who really knows his stuff. Pretty cool guy and knows when it is alright to be laid back.","The class is challenging and a lot of work but you'll learn and grow a lot. Anastassia is incredibly supportive and organized in her approach to teaching \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0she always makes sections engaging.","It is a good class","Understanding Altruism with Erez and Moshe is an INCREDIBLE tutorial, and probably actually my favorite class that I've taken at Harvard during my two years here. The readings and class discussions are fascinating, and you can really tailor the class to your specific interests within the general realm of \"altruism.\" Plus, Erez\/Moshe are two of the most understanding and kind and fun people ever, which is a huge plus. Overall, definitely would recommend.","Take it end of story","TAKE YONATHAN'S CLASS!!!!","This class was one of my favorites.","If you are interested in climate change and other environmental issues that occupy the media spotlight, be aware that this course is only about 20% focused on that sort of issue. A lot of time is spent on fisheries, niche topics, and understanding fundamental environmental resource economics. I was not nearly as interested in the material as I had expected. All that said, Rebecca is an EXCELLENT instructor. She is very engaged, excited about the material, and eager to help students however she can. She made me enjoy the class a lot more than I may have given the material.","Vladimir is the perfect teacher for the Mergers, Acquisitions, and LBOs tutorial and he cares very much about the students and their development. The tutorial is well structured so that theoretical ideas are followed by practical applications of them, leading to a thorough conceptual understanding of M&A from both a theoretical and industry perspective. The workload is high, but well worth it. It is one of the few classes at Harvard that includes lots of seminar-style discussion, but also involves a huge amount of hands-on projects. That means that you are doing something applied, interesting, and practical - and are taught how to do it in a thorough, engaging fashion. Vladimir is also a great discussion leader and is great at motivating the class and instilling excitement about the content. This seminar is easily the best class at Harvard I have taken so far.","While it's amazing and awe-inspiring to learn from someone like Boycko, it would be far better to have him as a lecturer than as a section-host. He assumes that everyone has a large base of knowledge about Russia, and often the readings were not enough to keep up in class. Grading is also very haphazard, and overall, the classroom atmosphere is not particularly encouraging (most things that you say will be wrong, because Maxim lived it and will be able to tell you that something was not the case).","Lot of commitment and time to work hard and learn - come eager to learn and expect to work hard","It's an amazing course if you are looking to going into a career in finance. It can be a lot of work at times but it is very rewarding.","Do not preference a section because you think it will be easy. Select the one that seems the most interesting to you.","Go to class","Unfortunately, there's no getting around this course for concentrators.  But I would HIGHLY recommend that you make sure you like the topic of your tutorial section.  Otherwise, the whole semester is like pulling teeth and you will have to spend a lot of time digesting material that you really aren't interested in.  It's a lot of reading of academic papers, which is already dry, so choose something that you'd actually enjoy.","Really try to understand all of the readings. It's easy to read a paper and think you understand, but then once discussion starts you can be very confused.","PSYCHOLOGY & ECONOMICS IS THE BEST TUTORIAL BY FAR! It is the most painless AND the most interesting. The only reason you SHOULDNT take this is if you really aren't interested in psychology, but once you start learning about the subject matter it's addicting. Great class.","You will learn more in this class about the material covered and about yourself than you will at most other classes at Harvard.","Vitaly is awesome and super helpful with all the materials covered in class. Don't be intimidated by the complicated sounding topics, everything gets broken down and it's a very manageable course. Take it","This course is instrumental in understanding finance and finance-related economic concepts. The financial modeling projects allow you to know how bankers think. One step higher, we get to analyze finance at an economic and theoretical level, which ultimately culminates in a research paper in which we apply finance with economic theory.","Take Hillel Bavli's class called Introduction to the Economic Analysis of Law. It will be one of the best if not the best class you will take at Harvard. He is a phenomenal instructor who has a vast knowledge of not only economics but also of statistics and law. The class is very reasonable in terms of workload, and you will get out of it what you put in. The readings are extremely interesting and worth your time. Each class is different, and Hillel makes sure the discussion is always stimulating. As someone who came in with no real knowledge of the law, I left with a strong desire of going to law school simply because of the fascinating nature of the course and of Hillel's teaching ability. He goes above and beyond to ensure you understand the concepts of the course while making every lesson engaging. Hillel is able to foster class discussion in which we use examples and broad terms to formulate the underlying law and the economic theories that make it up. If you would like to get the most out of your tutorial experience, take Hillel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s class.","One of my favorite classes at Harvard! Hillel is a great teacher- he's super genuine and interesting, and he is really great at offering counterarguments\/followup questions in a way that makes you think further. Looking at law through an economic perspective is something that I never thought much about before this class, but it is really interesting and thought provoking. Made me think differently about economics as a discipline in a different way. You will look forward to going to class!!!","This class was a great introduction to the basics of law and provide a great framework for thinking about legal issues from an economic lens. The courseload for each class was very reasonable and I found that I would walk away from each section with new ideas and thoughts about the way that I interact with the world on a daily basis.","I enjoyed the class part so much. My TF was wonderful, and the content she introduced on developmental and behavioral economics was fascinating. The stata component was poorly integrated into the structure of Ec970 and was tedious and time-consuming. I learned very little from it. The research paper was also a little much. I can't imagine exactly how I could have been better prepared for it, but it still felt quite daunting.","Very practical. Worth the effort.","This course easily makes the top three for me in terms of my favorite courses at Harvard. I knew it would be the very best Ec970 course for me given the topic, but it was really Hillel who made the course excellent. As such, make sure you like law and reasoning the law-- but even if you don't I am certain that Hillel would get you to like it.","Take it. Hillel is great and will get you to be enthusiastic not only about the course but also about adventurous decisions in life.","Amazing class","Nuegeboren is a tough grader, but the course was excellent! The material was very interesting and the class was worth it.","Yonathan is a great TF. He really cares about the material and is very knowledgable. He also puts time into having small class discussions about world phenomena that can really be useful life skills.","Roy is so chill!","Professor Neugeboren's tutorial on game theory was a fairly painless way of satisfying the sophomore tutorial requirement, but it was boring at times. Sections could drag on without much discussion. Additionally, there were times that expectations were somewhat unclear. If you're looking for a class that provides you with every-day applications of game theory, then you may be disappointed, but the final paper provides a cool opportunity to do research on a topic of interest to you.","Amazing tutorial! Erez and Moshe are incredible. So interesting to combine economics with psychology and evolutionary theory. This class will change how you think about altruism, charity, and philanthropy. Definitely take this super interesting tutorial led by amazing people!","This course is an unbelievable experience, life changing. The course really culminated in a economic final research paper geared towards taking a statistical approach to the concepts we learned in private equity.","This was an amazing introduction to finance, as so many Harvard students are interested in the field. One must be willing to work very hard and commit substantial time to the course, but it was well worth it.","The class will give you as much as you put into it. It's possible to get by with a basic understanding of the material, but doing so would be a big waste of your time. The material can be very interesting and certainly came up in quite a few interviews I did during the semester. I would recommend starting your assignments well in advance so you can incorporate ideas and themes from the readings into your paper. Any background knowledge in accounting will be helpful.","Randall is the best! He's amazing at explaining things, and the class is really fun!","Great class with great professors. Would recommend it to anyone having any interest in behavioral economics and\/or altruism","Definitely a different and slightly difficult class, but something that you have to take. It will be different for you because you are really specializing in a specific area. The energy component of the course was excellent.","Be extremely prepared to do an immense amount of work and learning. Vladimir leaves no doubt when he tells you about the amount of work that will be done. However, this will be the most rewarding class you will ever take: an understanding of the financial markets both in a macro and micro sense are invaluable tools for anyone regardless of future occupations.","This is the best class I've ever taken at Harvard. The professors are absolutely amazing!","Great class with a great learning environment.  Poverty and inequality with Randall is a great class.","Randall was always happy to provide extra help, constructive criticism, and productive feedback on all assignments. Classes were always informative and interesting, and Randall's enthusiastic and candid attitude allowed me to learn a lot from the class.","Understanding Altruism with Erez and Moshe = hands down the best EC970 section there is. The two instructors are funny, quirky, exciting, passionate, and engaging. They will ask hard questions to craft your social psych, evolutionary bio, & game theorist mind set. What a dynamic duo with a real love for the work that they do! I learned SO many useful and practical things (like how to design a field experiment, how to do some useful things in Stata, how to ask important questions, how to treat people, etc.). Not only expanded my love for Economics tenfold, but also helped me understand my preferences for and my interactions with the world around me.",".","I took M&A and LBOs with Vlad. I think the winter storm messed up the organization of the class, but overall the class is a little too hyped. Vlad said this would be his final year teaching the class at the College, but if you decide to take the class at the Law School (or College if he decides to return), I would recommend taking easier classes because this class basically sucks your life. The amount of work and preparation for section and assignments is beyond belief, and while I did enjoy the material, I did feel like we had to learn from doing as opposed to learning from section. The work at the end of the semester is absolutely insane, so make sure you don't have any major assignments due at the end of the semester (including reading period). Not the worst class I've taken, but definitely not the best. It's the only class closest to finance, so I would recommend taking the class if you're really set on going into IB.","A lot of boring work","Roy is an awesome dude. Take it.","It is a great way to learn about the connection between economics and the environment and potential ways to improve both, mostly through policy.","best class I have taken at Harvard! Ovul is an AMAZING TF so brilliant and so smart, class was full of laughs and learning every session! Still very difficult to earn an A in this class","This is exactly how classes at Harvard and everywhere else should be taught. Plenty of great feedback from an expert in the field really helps a student to develop their interest in research and creating new knowledge in the field, something that is pretty cool. Plenty of options for tutorials and subjects in the econ department as well.","If you care about important economic policy questions facing the country and want to discuss them in detail with your peers, take this class.","Marek is a very enthusiastic and dedicated instructor. Take this course if you are interested in reading the work of Nobel Laureates and other economists, and if you are willing to do quite a bit of reading. However, the discussions are very entertaining and enlightening, and the in-class exercises and games are very enjoyable.","If you're having any qualms about which Tutorial to enroll in, make sure your top choice is Understanding Altruism. Erez and Moshe are incredible teachers. However, if you want to contribute the most to your section, you should enroll because you're earnestly interested in altruism. The course contains large components of game theory and modeling, but it really helped me to have a strong desire to learn about altruism.","I am reviewing Nobel Prize-Winning Contributions to Economics. \r\nGreat course. Lots of readings. Great discussion. Gives you a great overview of the field of economics (and the major trends and everything that has been celebrated). \r\n\r\nMarek is a great discussion leader.","This was by far my favorite class so far and I think about it all the time as it applies to almost every situation.","Incredible incredible class that really integrates economic analysis into concepts of contract law. Yonathan truly takes what for many is a rather dull subject of contracts and turns it into material exciting and very applicable to every day life. This is a tutorial where the instructor truly makes the class wonderful.","This is the best class I have taken at Harvard! The subject matter is fascinating and the teachers are two of the most graceful, interesting, and thought-provoking humans you will ever meet!","I thought \"Economic Analysis of Law\" was the best Economics class I've taken at Harvard, and Hillel was the best instructor I've had in any of my Economics courses.","This class is a fantastic introduction to the economic literature on immigration. Anne is a great teacher and will work with you until you understand the topics thoroughly. Be warned that the readings are dense at times, but you will get a lot out of them if you put in a good effort.","This was the most amazing course I have taken at Harvard. It was very challenging, but in the best possible way. I learned how to read, discuss, and review economics papers, as well as conduct and present my own research. The topic (immigration) was incredibly interesting, and we really covered so many aspects\/dimensions of it. Anne was the most thoughtful, passionate instructor, and I am so grateful to have taken this class with her!","I would tell future students that this class is applicable to real-world issues, and that it is very interesting to learn.","You don't know what you're missing if you don't take this class. It's hard as heck at times, and you will stay up late. However, at the end of the semester, you feel like a banker.","Great section with the Noels! Stata psets can be frustrating, but are ultimately very useful if ec research is something that you will do in the future.","Messing with Markets was without a doubt one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard.  Peter Tu is the best tutorial leader out there.  The material was all really interesting and thought-provoking, though never so elevated that it was inaccessible.  Expectations were made pretty evident, and I learned an enormous amount.  This was a truly amazing class.","Very interesting material, I've never studied law before but found this course engaging. Discussions are interesting and the workload is manageable. Highly recommend this course. Hillel is a great section leader.","Rebecca is very passionate about Environmental Economics and this carries over to this course. It has been one of my favorite that I've taken at Harvard. In this class, we were able to apply what we've learned in our economics classes to real world scenarios which I really enjoyed. This class was much more interesting that previous Ec requirements I've had to meet.","Behavioral Finance with Anastassia was a pretty good class that was a bit boring at times. I really enjoyed the sophomore tutorial for providing a smaller setting to learn more about research at giving me a specific topic to work on and a single individual in the Economics department to get close with. Anastassia is very nice and has a pretty interesting background, so you should try to get to know her outside of class, although, she can be a somewhat tough grader. In class discussions could be a bit hard to follow and boring if you don't have some background and a significant interest in finance. I don't regret choosing this tutorial, but there may have been other ones I enjoyed more.","Roy is the best","The governance tutorial is great, but be prepared to read a lot and engage with your peers -- this year, the students who self-selected into this class were all top econ students, so it was not for the faint of heart.","Take it!! It is one of the few opportunities in the college to learn about investment and valuation mechanisms in detail","Vladimir is all-knowing. I learned so much taking this class, and there was a good balance between readings on merger and merger strategy, how-to videos, and accounting principles. The in-class presentations were a great\/different way to test knowledge than the modeling project. This is the only class Harvard offers that gives you i-banking knowledge\/experience, so it is essential. It still managed to engage liberal arts skills such as critical analysis of text and essay writing. Vladimir gives great feedback on assignments and is always willing to meet after class or offer career advice.","I thoroughly enjoyed this class. The readings were interesting and dealt with every-day issues which is always nice. Samurah does a great job of encouraging debate and discussion in class without being forceful or anything like that. Definitely recommend taking it.","It was the best class that I have taken at Harvard.","This is a really good class, and if you're interested in development economics, political economy and understanding empirical techniques in economics, I strongly recommend the course. This past year, everyone in the class pretty much always did the readings, which made for particularly interesting discussion. A reasonable amount of work (though workload is pretty homogenous across 970 sections), and overall very interesting.","Fun way to address concepts that are important to everyday decisions. Definitely a good primer on understanding why some legal cases are decided on in certain ways. Topics are interesting but hoped we got into some juicier stuff.","Ec 970 with Rebecca Toseland (Markets and the Environment) is a wonderful way to fulfill the requirement. Rebecca is an enthusiastic and incredibly kind instructor who cares about all of her students. The materials range from fisheries to climate change, and every paper you write will be very relevant and prepare you for the final research paper. Rebecca goes out of her way to make sure you are learning. I highly recommend this course! (The Stata psets are probably the worst part, but there is no way out of those...)","This class is a great introduction to the skills one needs to learn in order to engage in economic research. While the Stata psets were hard, they were definitely very helpful. My preceptor, Sarika, was excellent, with a very clear and engaging  lecturing style and a commitment to fostering discussion. At the same time, working on the paper was very difficult, and it could have been helpful to have had more guidance earlier on in the course about how to think of a research topic. Overall, though, a class worth taking.","Re: Marek's course.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a breezy sophomore tutorial in ec, this is not the course for you. If you're looking for a course that will be extremely rewarding by require a lot of work, this is an excellent course. \r\n\r\nThe biggest difference between Marek's course and most sophomore tutorials is that this course does not dwell on any one topic for more than two weeks. This means each week's readings are fresh and interesting. You get to study the coolest stuff that's been done in economics -- it's dope. \r\n\r\nMarek is an eccentric and brilliant instructor. He runs a tight ship, which I appreciated, but he cares deeply about the quality of his course and clearly puts a LOT of effort into the class. It's impressive.\r\n\r\nThis course was my second choice when I got it, but I would make it my first if I had to do it again.","This class is (Psychology and Economics) is a very easy tutorial. If you are looking for something rigorous, I probably would not select this course!","Very interesting discussion based class led by a very knowledgeable instructor.","This is the best tutorial that you could take. It is fun and exciting and I really enjoyed it.","It's a tough class that will require a lot of intellectual and time investment, but you will learn a lot and, if you want to do development, it will be crucial to paper-writing and to reading studies","Informative yet outcome of course is very dependent on instructor.","A great balance between a relaxed seminar setting, and an informative one. Where I learnt a lot about the world, while not being stressed about the class.","Randall is a fantastic teacher and a great guy. Definitely take \"Poverty and Inequality\" if you are interested in the social policy side of economics.","I liked the small-class setting a lot, and Prof. Neugeboren in particular is an amazing instructor. He's very passionate about the subject, leads discussion well and his feedback is very helpful. Note that this tutorial seemed to be more challenging (both in terms of assignment length and grading) than most others. If you put in some work, however, it's very doable and rewarding. Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma tournament is super fun.","Get ready for the decent amount of work for this class. However, if you really put effort on it, you'll be rewarded with some cool Econ skills, such as knowing how to read, write and think as an economist."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["This course is an amazing way to dive deeply into debates that practitioners and academics alike are being faced with today surrounding global development. You will learn how to contemplate theories and value judgments as well as grow your analytical skills.

Kiran is extremely nice and has great insight into the material (development economics). Take this one if you can!","Take it! It was hands down my favorite class this semester. Ovul is a great lecturer and is very engaging. She's also doing some really cool work that helps give ideas about what you can do post grad.","Dorian is great","if you're interested in the psychology behind economics and consume decisions this class is great","A tutorial is harder than it seems, but at the end of the day it is super rewarding and helpful. I like this class a lot, and I felt that I learned a lot.","Great course! You learn a lot, and the course material is actually fun! It's not stressful nor is it boring\/tedious like you will find many other econ courses to be. I felt less stressed but also felt like I learned more from this econ class than I have others.","Front load response papers. Start as early and aggressively for the final paper as you can. It's not hard but if you take it during the fall major deadlines happen around Harvard-Yale Thanksgiving, and the last week of classes. Stata problems are long and difficult so start early and go to office hours (DO NOT DO THEM THE NIGHT BEFORE). Great class overall.","Would definitely recommend taking the tutorial on Environmental Economics because you learn so much on current and past issues through an economics framework that really makes you think about public resources and how the government and math works in all of it.","Take this course! The teacher is great and you will enjoy the discussions!","Matt is amazing and really wants students to engage with the class and texts","Dorian is a great tutorial leader, and the subject is very interesting, especially for those who are considering going into finance. The discussions are interesting, and the readings Dorian provides are helpful for papers as well as just gaining an understanding about the crisis and capital markets. He provides great feedback for assignments, and is very willing to meet in person to go over paper ideas or respond via email.","The section-based classes work well in facilitating discussions, and help you really dive into different topics. It's a great introduction for those students that haven't participated in a tutorial or seminar before.","This class is really interesting; be sure to participate a lot and get an early start on papers.","Psychology and Economics with Ovul is fantastic! Ovul makes journal articles very approachable, and I left the course with many new friends as well.","If you like discussion based classes and you are interested in economics, this is a great class to take. Roy was a great tutorial TF and he facilitated good discussions.","I think that it was confusing in the sense that the sections felt easy, yet we barely spoke about grades and assignments and how they were graded and what was expected from them. The tone of sections were far too different from the grading situation.","If you are interested in the financial crisis or even if you want to do something in the field of finance, I would highly recommend taking this class with Dorian Klein, if you can. He is extremely knowledgeable and overall an amazing person to get to know, and made this my favorite class this semester.","Take the course with Dorian Klein!! best section of all - you will love the conversations and discussions in class; his feedback on assignments and accessibility outside of the course are invaluable","I would recommend this course (and already have) with SOOO much enthusiasm.","Great class, Kiran is fantastic, but a lot of work.","In terms of ec tutorials, financial crisis with Dorian is a good one. Dorian is probably best, most chill professor out there. and if you're interested in financial crisis\/ finance\/ capital markets, this is probably the most relevant.","This class was my favorite this semester. Rebecca is so energetic and excited about the material, and it's contagious. You can tell she puts time into preparing for class and that she looks forward to teaching, which is so refreshing for an Ec class. This class made me realize how important the environment is and that if we don't do something about carbon emissions soon, the costs will be irreversible. I loved how applied the material was, and the final paper was very rewarding to research. This is a great tutorial that's informative, thought-provoking, and enjoyable, and it helps build a solid framework with which to view current environmental policy.","TAKE THIS CLASS!  Rebecca is awesome and generates so much enthusiasm for the subject matter.  The papers we read are perfect in terms of challenging you to think but also being easy enough to follow and gain insight into certain environmental conditions in conjunction with their economic implications.","This is the best course I have taken at Harvard. If you are interested in development, this course provides a great introduction to the topic. Although it is a lot of work and the reward is not always what you would expect in terms of the grade (Kiran is a tough grader), the material is so interesting that it is worth it!"]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["A lot of work but Elizabeth did a great job of trying to keep the class interesting every day.","Would recommend this class to any student who wants to get a clear insight on economic development, especially in Africa. Jonas knows the field extensively.","Be ready to work in this class- lots of reading and writing. To top it all off, the Stat problem sets are kind of difficult.","Enhances the enjoyment of studying economics","Great class. Sometimes I thought that sometimes Brandon would lecture too much and prevent a free flowing classroom discussion. Other than that, I thought it was a really good class. Brandon is a very interesting guy that has already done a lot in is life. Great to hear things from his perspective.","This was an awesome course. There was not as much STATA involvement as some of the other tutorials, but the topics were really engaging.","Do not expect tutorial to be light in workload.","US in the World Economy is a great class, hard writing assignments but very much worth the wok.","Dorian is a great tutorial teacher, I would aim to get his class. It's relevant, the papers aren't brutally hard, and Dorian is there to help you.","Even if the course material is not something that particularly interests you, it really is a fun and intriguing class.","Expect a tutorial that requires heavy reading, writing, and discussing. Be sure to choose a course that covers a topic that you truly enjoy, so that the effort you will put in is worthwhile. Start early on assignments, as there will be many that take a decent amount of your time.","This was a fantastic course, but especially since Cheng made the material engaging and exciting.","I would only recommend if you have to take it for a concentration requirement.","I can assure you this is objectively the best sophomore tutorial available. Cheng is almost entirely the reason why, but if this course is offered in the future with a different instructor I think it would still be great from the material alone","This class involves a lot of reading but is actually applicable to the real world. The specific tutorial that you take really determines how difficult it will be, but there are none that have low workloads. The Stata problems sets are annoying but slightly helpful during the final paper. Do not procrastinate the final paper because you will likely need additional feedback throughout the process from your TF and the Stata TFs.","amazing TF - one of the best. subject matter is super interesting, but stata PSETS suck and teach you literally nothing. LOTS of work so make sure you space it out and stay on top of it, but as far as sections go, David's was the best. he's not teaching this again, so rough for you but he was wonderful for us","Sad to say that this won't be offered next year - we are the last crop of Marek students. I hope someone takes over this class in the future, because it's a fantastically fun course, and I honestly enjoyed learning under Marek's sense of humor and instruction.","the concept of labor inequality is very interesting to me, and i think that this course does an excellent job of diving into these inequalities.","Dov and Aaron are great. Not too hard overall. Good time.","I would highly recommend taking this course. Sarika is a great section leader. She really know how to facilitate great discussions in class. The assignments are fair and the readings are interesting. She also gives great feedback on all the assignments. The only reason you shouldn't take this course if if you aren't interested in the subject matter. But if you are, this is the perfect section for you.","Take this course - the instructor is amazing!","it's very interesting","Your experience that you take away from the sophomore tutorial is largely dependent on the instructor. Because the instructor is the one who designs the syllabus and directs the discussion during class, it's so important that he or she be well prepared. I highly recommend that future students talk to previous year's students to figure out which tutorials have been great. In addition, make sure you'll be actually interested in the topic - check out the syllabus readings carefully because that will also dictate the type of experience you get from the class. You'll have to write a final paper on that topic after all.","Start assignments early !","Hillel is one of the most incredible people I've met during my time at Harvard. He truly wants everyone in the class to be successful, whether they are interested in the law or not. He always gave his best effort in correcting our assignments and gave us advice that will apply to our work throughout college. TAKE THIS CLASS!","incredible!","Quality of instruction likely varies substantially by instructor. If Cheng Gao of HBS ever teaches again, put that section as the first choice.  Total workload pretty substantial, lots of readings and essays--don't take this as a light class.  Final paper writing can feel quite rewarding.","If you get a topic you like (which I did), Econ 970 will be an intellectually engaging seminar that will contrast wonderfully with your large lecture classes such as 1010 or 1011.","The Economics of Nutrition and Health (with Lauren Olsho) was pretty interesting, though it seemed like we ran out of topics and started reading very similar papers by the middle of the semester, which got monotonous. Lauren isn't the most engaging teacher, but she's very knowledgable about the subject matter and is very receptive to feedback. Overall a good experience and I would recommend this one, but there are probably better\/easier tutorials out there.","Although the sophomore tutorial is required for all economics majors, Monetary Policy would make an excellent choice. David was a great TF who broke down very complicated concepts into understandable bits. The material can get pretty confusing at some points and reading economics papers take a considerable amount of time to fully digest, but having a solid teacher who takes the time to go over them definitely makes this class worth taking. It was especially relevant in the current economic climate and you will leave feeling more educated about the ways in which our economy works.","This is a course which allows you to use what you have learned and apply it to policy and economic research. It gives you a new appreciation for economics after many semesters of simply studying supply and demand, GDP, etc.","The Ec 970 tutorial is a lot of work, but if you choose an area that interests you, you'll probably enjoy it. All the courses are heavily writing based and in addition the STATA mini course can take a good amount of time. I took The U.S. and the World Economy. Brandon Adams is a fairly good TF and knows a good amount about the subject matter. He was redesigning the course and readings my year, so I feel it will be even better in the future. For any section, I recommend you try to decide your final topic early on so that way you have ample time to collect data and perform the proper analyses.","Great course, just know that the structure is pretty loose and you have a lot of independence with where you want to go with your writing and your research paper.","This class gives you a chance to apply the abstract principles you learn in introductory classes to real world issues. Your economic intuition and writing skills will improve.","This course, much like Expos, is hugely dependent on which section leader you are assigned to in the lottery","The best economics course I have taken at Harvard.","I can speak only for Greg Bruich's section when I say that this is great.  Depends entirely on who your class leader is.","I don't know about other tutorials, but this one was very interesting.","This tutorial was one of the best classes I've taken so far in the sense that it covered some fascinating material.","Economic Analysis of Law seems like a daunting class by its name alone. However, it is actually very manageable and informative. The instruction is engaging and the readings, although long, are interesting and well selected.","Challenge, but so worth it.","You get out of it what you put in. Do the readings and you'll understand some cool, complex social insurance models and their real world implications.","Tutorial is great - no exams, just papers and readings. Get started on your final paper early! Frontloading is good.","Hillel's class on Economic Analysis of Law is an amazing Ec 970 option. Hillel is an amazing human, and his life stories will inspire and leave you in awe. He is a great resource, and really helps you to succeed. The material is incredibly interesting, and it covers a lot of law topics in just one semester.","Take the tutorial with Anastassia if you're at all interested in finance! She does a great job teaching the concepts\/explaining the papers and I think it's a great introduction to behavioral finance\/information in financial markets. It's definitely not super applied finance (since you're reading academic finance papers), but Anastassia successfully makes it as relevant to the real world as possible (ask her about her experiences at Goldman if that's something you're interested in). Also, Anastassia gives superb feedback and she'll help you write a killer final paper. Highly recommended!","Consumer Finance with Yizhou and Yosub was a good course. Yizhou and Yosub are both highly intelligent, and it is interesting to learn about consumer and investor behavior. This class seemed quite fair in general as well (do the work, do well), though I would recommend you make sure the material interests you before you sign up. The material is interesting, in my opinion, but some people may find it to be more dry.","Jonas is one of the most kind-hearted and genuine professors I have met at Harvard, and the developmental economics course topic is unlike any other sophomore tutorial offered. We covered a vast amount of African economic development topics, such as internal conflict, colonial institutions and even psychological factors at play in the Sub-Saharan african economy. Coming into the course, I had only taken Statistics 104 and basic economics classes thus I felt slightly nervous about the prospect of a econometric research paper and in-class analysis of famous papers with difficult econometric models. I expected the tutorial to be dry and challenging at best, yet under Jonas guidance of tutorial discussion, I felt truly engaged with the topics we were covering and comfortable speaking up about my opinions despite my limited background knowledge. By the end of my term paper, I felt as if I had actually learned quite a lot about economics research at large, and it has convinced me to pursue developmental economics in further courses (and possibly as a thesis topic): it was easily my favorite course of the semester. If you are looking for a tutorial that truly makes you learn about a topic outside of your usual realm of expertise, fine tunes your writing skills and pushes you in an encouraging classroom setting, Jonas' Sub-Saharan African class is the tutorial for you.","a lot of reading","Interesting but difficult to understand.","You have to take this class! It's amazing!","Daniel Lewis teaches Monetary Economics. This is not the most straightforward 970, but I think our class learned more than any other 970. The papers he gives us are modern, crucial papers by well known economists. They are not easy to read, but the progress I made throughout the semester is incredible. I entered this class wanting to be an investment banker (who would've guessed?) but left the class very interested in entering econ grad school and getting a phd. If you want a 970 you can sleep through, do not take this class. If you want to leave the semester and feel like you learned  a lot and wrote some good papers, this is the one to take. Side note: everyone should know monetary policy; this class will help you understand it better than everyone else.","Hillel's section, Economics of the Law, is amazing!!! Definitely the best class I've taken at Harvard. However, the stata psets are terrible. They are way harder than the examples given, the only way you can possibly do them is to get help at stata office hours. They take forever and give this class the workload of two courses at times. The section component is awesome but the stata psets put a damper on the course.","Do the reading.","The papers are a LOT of work, start early.","You have to spend a lot of time on the papers.","Best TF and class you will ever take at this school. Period.","Take Jonas' tutorial","This is one of the best, if not the best course I have ever taken. Business strategy is fascinating as it is the study of how economics and perfect competition break down. This course is similar to one at HBS with more econometrics, and the HBS style is an experience undergraduates should have, looking at cases etc... Cheng Gao was an incredible section leader and engendered a really close community in the class, everyone worked very hard and had a lot of fun. Lottery for this!!!","Its hard, but you learn a lot. Basically two classes with Stata P-sets","Hillel is amazing!!! He's a super accomplished person and really smart, and really good at leading interesting class discussions. I always feel comfortable talking during class because Hillel always has something positive to say, even if he disagrees. Definitely take this class I really recommend it!!","Do not take this course unless you are surely intending to concentrate in economics. Thank you. That is all.","(Strategy and Competitive Advantage w\/Cheng Gao): This was quite honestly the best class I've taken during my time at Harvard. I haven't engaged with a teacher as much in my time at Harvard as I had with Cheng. He taught us more than I would have ever thought a sophomore tutorial will teach me. He created a dynamic in our class that was incredibly fun, enjoyable, while still very packed with material. We learned more in our one semester than strategy courses offered at Wharton MBA! Cheng truly cares about the growth and development of each student, and takes every possible effort to make our experience in the class the best it can be. Furthermore, Cheng enriched the class by scheduling talks with the largest VC firm in Boston, the COO of the New England Patriots, the CEO of Boeing, and other really accomplished individuals, giving us a sense that what we learn in the class isn't limited to just the class. Cheng offers advice on not just business strategy, but also strong career advice as well, drawing from a breadth of experiences he's had. I think the saddest thing is that he won't be teaching this tutorial again next semester, and there's a crop of ~10 lucky ec concentrators who didn't get to experience his style. We slayed many a dragon and drank many a Honest Tea in our time with Cheng, and I'm sad that it's over now, but am so glad that I got to experience it.","Only take if you are an economics concentrator.","Ec 970: Social Insurance with Greg Bruich was absolutely phenomenal.  If you are interested at all in Medicare, Medicaid, Unemployment Insurance, Disability Insurance, Basic Income, etc. then take this class.  Greg is an unbelievable instructor.  He helps you understand papers that are on the forefront of the field (we read like ten papers published within the last year alone), he is extremely helpful if you ever have questions about the material or stata, and he is an understanding and kind man.  I will almost definitely write my senior thesis on a topic I began exploring in this class.","The material in this class is technical and difficult, and is not carefully taught beyond the readings. Some understanding of the New Keynesian is necessary to get the most out of the technical readings. That said, it is also possible to skate by without it.","Hillel was really good. The course was great.","If you are interested in Social Insurance, this is a great class! Greg is very kind and knowledgeable. He made the experience worthwhile.","Depends heavily on which section you're in. Pick based on the instructor more so than the material.","Amazing teacher","Anastassia is brilliant and delightful- a natural teacher. The assignments are very well paced, with response papers fulfilling most of the writing requirements. When the final paper rolls around, the weekly assignments and referee reports will have adequately prepared you for the workload. The material itself is involved at points, but will give you a strong background in finance and the empirical methods of economics.","I took the class on strategic human resource management and Yo-Jud was an amazing TF.  She was very friendly and passionate and always tried to make our class interesting.  I felt that this was actually my favorite class of the semester just because all of the topics we covered were extremely applicable but diverse.  The weekly response papers weren't difficult and she was always willing to help out when we were having a hard time with our longer papers.","Take Social Insurance with Greg Bruich. Not only is the class interesting, Greg is one of the nicest, best teachers I've ever had. He is always willing to meet with you and help you, especially with the final paper. He is amazing, and you should take any tutorial he teaches.","Research paper is funner than it sounds.","I would tell students interested in taking the capital markets section of this class, that while interesting, it is far harder than other sections of the class. At times, I seriously questioned the professor's pedagogical style. He taught the class through a bizarre \"guess the number\" thing where he stood at the blackboard and asked questions like \"What was the rate of GDP growth in Romania in 1973.\" We would guess answers for three minutes until someone happened upon what the professor thought was the right answer. Not only was this style incredibly un-engaging, the numbers themselves were usually wrong. I feel like I really missed out on an academic experience this semester by not taking this class from an actual academic or phd student in economics. If you like finance and guessing arbitrary numbers, then I guess this section is for you. It certainly wasn't for me.","Very applicable class. Worth taking.","Great course on a very interesting topic.  Very enjoyable.","This class will give you the opportunity to take the economics you have learned and actually apply it in conversation and research to things that interest you. You'll learn about everything from US-China sustainability to technological disruption of the labor force.","This is a really great class, where you learn a lot about the world while applying economic reasoning and critical thinking to have interesting discussions. Governance and Corruption is the tutorial to take if you're doing economics to learn about the world, government, and policy.","readings are tough, stata psets are BRUTAL, much more quantitative than I had expected, but overall it's a very fulfilling course. You learn a lot, no doubt","For a leg up take econometrics first!","This is a fantastic class! I learned so much about economics research from class discussions and Jonas' lectures. You'll read a wonderful set of influential papers that are picked by Jonas. This is a great foray into economics research and you'll learn a lot about Africa, but also about development economics in general. I also found that this course helped re-motivate my interest in economics after not particularly enjoying the intermediate micro\/macro class series. \r\n\r\nThe 970-wide assignments may seem like a lot, but you do come away from the whole experience being able to write a full economics paper, use stata to explore data, etc.","If you have any interest in studying law, this is a great introductory course.","Wonderful tutorial! The course material is interesting, readings are well-selected, and Sarika is a really great teacher.","Depending on which tutorial you get, can be really interesting material. Do the readings so you can participate in the discussion during class.","This is a great course. I took Strategic Human Resource Management with Yo-Jud Cheng and I recommend it to everyone! It was a very new topic of study from what I am used to and really got me to think about the workplace. Yo-Jud was an absolutely amazing instructor. She cares about the students and the subject so much. She is extremely intelligent and such a great teacher.","I would only take this class if I was very interested in mergers: otherwise, can feel somewhat dry with limited applicability to other careers\/courses. Dov and Aaron are great instructors and great people, I think it's just the nature of the course. Note that there's no Stata work, if that's something that will be important to you (i.e. if you're writing a thesis)","Dorian is my favorite teacher I've had at Harvard so far!! Take this class!","Phenomenal course that helps you decide whether or not a thesis is the right thing for you.","Very interesting tutorial with a great professor who is willing to help you whenever needed!","Take this class! This is by far the best seminar leader. Dorian Klein literally flies in twice a week from Washington DC in order to teach you. He has a lot of great experience in the finance industry and he has some really cool stories. You learn a lot from him and the class is very useful."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Professor Klein is absolutely amazing! If you haven't felt passionate about financial markets you definitely will in this class.","Good class with interesting readings","Class is all about finding something you're interested in. A good TF will make that class awesome for you. I would also look closely at the syllabus for each tutorial because some of them vary greatly in their type of work and amount of work.","Industry Analysis is a lot of work and a lot is expected from the students. At the end of the course you will definitely feel rewarded, especially if you put a lot of work  into your final paper.","Great material and a great section leader.","Get started on the research paper and find data sources early","Studying Development Economics will make you look at the world differently. Diana is the greatest TF - she's always accessible, will give you in-depth feedback on every assignment, and if you're interested in a career in Development Ec, brings in speakers that will help you work out the right path for you.","great TF","It isn't too much work and very interesting. Definitely one of the better ec tutorials","Take this section of the class! Very interesting! Lots of things to learn and super diverse so you're probably bound to be interested in something!","Make sure you find a topic and teacher you really like -- it makes all the difference","You can succeed in this class if you work hard and you'll want to work hard because you'll be learning things with obvious real world benefits.","If it's offered again, take Diana Goldemberg's Economic Development tutorial! Development economics is such an interesting field, and Diana is such an engaging and thoughtful instructor; she does so much to make the class a great experience. Start thinking about your final paper early!","If you are interested in Finance or Accounting this is a great place to start.","Read the syllabus of the tutorial you pick.  Some have far too much work.","Great introduction to real economics seminars. Interesting topics.","some readings are quite dry but most of them are really interesting","You should take Alicia's Entrepreneurship tutorial if you can. Alicia is a very accessible and friendly instructor who genuinely wants to teach her students and get them excited about entrepreneurship and economic research. It's not a light reading load, but the articles are generally interesting and Alicia is good as leading discussion. She is also very willing to meet to discuss the course\/final projects. Overall a great tutorial!","Great class with Haris! Papers can be somewhat dry and class discussion not always intense but you get what you put in and the subject material and guest speakers were terrific. A lot of reading! Interesting topic and you definitely learn a lot. Make sure not to fall behind.","This course can be quite a bit of work but the teachers put in an incredible amount of time to help you through it. Absolutely worth it.","The statistics may be a bit dry, but the class gave me a whole new perspective on how businesses operate and how management can manipulate financial statements.","Not much structure or feedback but overall satisfactory course","In speaking with my peers who took this class, your tutorial experience is largely dependent on your section leader. Thomas was phenomenal, making himself extremely available outside of class, as well as demonstrating great enthusiasm and in-depth knowledge of Trade Policy on a daily basis.","Don't take it unless you have a very strong quantitative background","The sophomore tutorials in the Ec Department are generally meant to be good, but this tutorial was genuinely the best class I have taken at Harvard so far. Daniel Lewis is a fantastic instructor. I learned more in this class than I have in all of my intermediate theory courses. It is probably the most involved tutorial (in terms of time requirements and mathematical\/economic theory preparation), so beware of this fact when ranking your preferences.","It depends on your TF. Some I hear are great, others okay, and some plain awful. I highly recommend having Econometrics before or while taking this course. It will make writing the essays much easier.","This should be the number one selected tutorial.","Do the readings over the weekend.","This class has a lot of writing and boring readings. Before you choose this class and decide on having economics as your major, reevaluate your decision of choosing economics because this semester will definitely make all of the uncertain Econ major realize if this major is truly for them.","Between all of the readings, the presentations, and the assignments before the final paper it's a lot of work. But its a really interesting topic and I genuinely enjoyed the readings. Also you will be happy with the result of your final paper. Definitely have a strong mathematical background or be familiar with complex economic and mathematical concepts. Even though it was a lot of work, I'm genuinely happy that I took this class.","This class was a lot of work, but I also learned a lot.","I loved this class! I learned so much about how I can actually use my economics degree and about business management. Honestly it was so great.","The readings are often very insightful but there is a lot to read every week. It is overall a very good course to learn about the academia side of economics.","I took Understanding the Financial Crisis with Dorian Klein. He is so nice and great, and the class is really applicable. Not a huge workload, substantive readings, 3 papers, 1 big final paper, and the stata p-sets. Highly recommend!","Megan Bailey is awesome! This course is a lot of work, but not challenging work. It was interesting too!","I really enjoyed this course. If you are interested in public finance and public economics, learning about issues like financial crises, debt, and other important topics that very much play out in the world right now, this is a good course for you. The material can be challenging but any technical papers are very well explained in class.","TAKE THIS CLASS. Diana is absolutely incredible. It was not a high stress class and allowed you to really soak in the material in a non-stressful environment. It is really rewarding to write your own paper at the end using all the skills you learned along the way. Economic development is a growing field and so much fun to learn about! You really learn how to critically think about policy implications of economic development strategies.","The course overall isn't very well-put together, but Ken's section is really good. There's no math involved, just reading and writing. He's very laid-back and focuses more on the discussions than on the assignments. The psets are super annoying and take forever to do, but there's no way around that.","Good class. Make section fun by speaking up and sharing your thoughts!","This class guides you through an introduction to academic economic writing and analysis.","Dont get too upset if you dont get your first choice. You will be pleasantly surprised.","If you can get sports economics, it will be one of the best courses you take at Harvard.","Put it as your first choice -- you won't regret it. Alicia is the most wonderful tutorial leader in the Ec department. The course will train you think like a seasoned entrepreneur, and push you to new intellectual heights.","Unemployment is actually a really interesting topic. I really learned a lot from this class and enjoyed doing the readings.","Nothing","Its awesome if you love sports","Definitely one of the best sophomore tutorials available. While the readings can get a bit dry at times, Alicia does a great job engaging the class in insightful discussion.","Take this tutorial! Diana is a super passionate instructor and development is fascinating! It's not too much work and the readings are incredibly interesting.","The course material is very dense and kind of difficult throughout the semester, but if you're interested in unemployment and policy development\/evaluation, this difficulty isn't that big of a deal. Marie-Pascale is a great, kind teacher, and you'll end the semester knowing way more than when you started.","Keep up with the readings, they're quite informative and interesting. Just make sure you really prepare well for presentations and don't be afraid to speak up because if you dont... it will be dead silent in class. it's a small class too so it's not like you can just hide in the background.","Judd is the man. To take his class I think a basic understanding of most sports is helpful and an interest in sports in general will keep you from getting bored.","Likely to recommend if you get the right class in the lottery. Some teachers and classes were pretty bad from what I heard","Econ 970 is section dependent. Try to keep up with the readings and speak in class. Doing those two things will allow you to take the most out of your 970 experience.","The quality of the tutorial probably varies widely from course to course. If you're an econ nerd who really wants to be challenged and learn to do good research, try to find a topic that interests you and that probably won't attract many football players and finance bros. If you're in the right section, your maturity as an economist can skyrocket, and you will come out feeling confident in digesting and creating economic's research.","Wonderful tutorial!","This tutorial is very interesting. first ec class where it applied to current trends and more relevant info.","You will get out of it what you put into it.","If you have an interest in monetary economics or are thinking about conducting research in economics (e.g., a thesis or even a PhD), then Daniel's tutorial is a good one to take. The papers we read are very technical, so you get a good look at how you'd go about conducting research that involves more econometrics and math. So if you're not comfortable with some more math or econometrics, you might have some trouble following along. But Daniel does do a good job of explaining things and making them less complicated. After talking with students in other tutorials, I feel like we learned more economics than you would in most. Also, Daniel is very accessible outside of class and is a helpful TF, and does a great job with this tutorial, which ended up being more interesting than I thought it would be. If you don't have an interest in monetary economics, however, you might be better off looking into other tutorials.","Similar to Expos it really makes a difference who your teacher is. If you get a good teacher you will enjoy it. Also choose a topic that interests you.","Dorain is great.  He talks a ton during class so you don't get a chance to say a word but that's not necessarily a bad thing. He's very passionate about the topic and is a wealth of knowledge and will completely prepare you for junior recruiting\/internship in finance.","Make sure you are really interested in the discussion topic otherwise the weekly readings\/writings might be tedious and not fun to do.","This course is great as you finally get to take an Economics course with a small number of people. Weiling is a great teacher\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0she is very knowledgeable and encourages discussion well.","Megan is a great TF but soph tutorial is too tight with requirements not helping you learn as much as I think you should in a tutorial!","The sophomore tutorial depends mostly on who your section leaders are.  Sophie and Brad taught Healthcare economics and I recommend people take their section if you are interested  in the topic.","Great class if the field interests you.","Great introduction to research.","Marion is the best TF that I have had at Harvard. She balances the readings and in class discussion so well and is extremely engaging with the topics that we discuss. If you have an interest in public finance\/monetary economics, TAKE THIS CLASS. She is super kind and helpful as well as you move along with the course, and she really cares about each and every student.","Shosh and Ash obviously dedicate themselves to their work. It is a pleasure to be part of that work for a semester. It might be hard, but it will be rewarding.","Learn stata","This course is at times frustrating in terms of the response papers that then sometimes combine with psets and readings for that week. Getting organized towards the beginning of the semester is key.","be prepared to have this course challenge you","Ec970 was instrumental in my realization that Ec is not for me. too much tedious Stata work to support too many tenuous theories.","This course was amazing! Daniel was always super helpful and the content was very interesting","This was a very rewarding class to take.","If you have the slightest curious about development economics, this course is a good fit.","Awesome elective definitely take it if you are lucky enough to get into it.","Sports econ is awesome- Judd is the man.  Obviously, the lottery for this will be competitive but if you get it you lucked out.  970 as a whole though is kind of brutal- only reason why I liked it is probably because of the subject matter of my seminar.  Definitely recommend taking metrics beforehand (or concurrently) as it will make your life a lot easier- I did not and regret it a little."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"5.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"167","response rate":"82.63","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 970","course_id":"932","cat_num":"122752","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"15","5s":"20"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 970","course_id":"932","cat_num":"7923","1s":"0","2s":"14","3s":"88","4s":"46","5s":"15"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 970","course_id":"932","cat_num":"122752","1s":"0","2s":"24","3s":"9","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
