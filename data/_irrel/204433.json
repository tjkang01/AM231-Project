Don't second guess your instincts, trust your gut and take the course. Even for those not interested in ed policy, this course will still be a pleasure and one that guarantees to bring tangible learning outcomes.","Honestly one of the best professors I've had in undergrad or grad school.","This course is a great way to see econometrics in action. Although not terribly rigorous, the readings are well chosen and you will actually learn a lot about the empirical support or lack thereof behind different educational policy measures. Additionally the debate and its corresponding memo are a nice way to dig deep into a particular area of education policy. While the requirements throughout the semester are fairly light, it is recommended, though not entirely necessary, that one has a background in econometrics. Additionally, it should be noted that Professor Goodman very strictly follows the HKS curve guidelines. Overall this was a great course and I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants to explore education policy further through the lens on econometrics."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
