Interesting readings, stimulating simulations, and great professor.","A simple set-up: each week, read a supreme court case or two and other political science\/law arguments, come to section and discuss them. That offered exposure to many different issues in the country today, which was really interesting. You will get the most out of this course if you do all the readings and come to section ready to talk. There is some flexibility in choosing a paper topic, but very little technical guidance. So in preparing to write a thesis, this class will not be very helpful.","This course is a great way to engage with the issues of constitutional law. But students should recognize going in that its merely a US constitutional law seminar. The course has a lot of reading but it is definitely doable if managed correctly."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"3.30","difficulty":"3.30","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"42.86","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 94pr","course_id":"2183","cat_num":"10858","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 94pr","course_id":"2183","cat_num":"10858","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 94pr","course_id":"2183","cat_num":"10858","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
