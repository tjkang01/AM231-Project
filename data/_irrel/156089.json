Depending on whose section you are assigned to, the feedback and discussion may be more or less helpful than other sections'.","Convince the BBS program to drop this course as a requirement before it's too late!!!","very useful, but it depends on your section.","It forces you to write a proposal and gives you a deadline. It makes it less intimidating since you know it's just a first, or second draft. It was a useful exercise. But other aspects of the course (e.g. reading papers, writing critiques) is a lot of work!","Great feedback on PQE aims from faculty.","Hold out, like the BIG students.","The class is nice because you get to write your PQE and get feedback from classmates and instructors. It can be difficult depending on which students are in your group and who runs your section.","The course is useful in that it forces you to start your PQE proposal well in advance.  Overall, the feedback from PIs and students was helpful in highlighting portions of your proposal which may not be clear.  However, I don't think this class is absolutely necessary.","Try to get out of this class at any cost.","If you can take a different class with a proposal writing component and have it count for BBS330, definitely do it.","You should already have a draft or at least an outline of a potential research project to get the most out of BBS330.","Nothing.","It may help you think about your project early, but expectations for constructive criticism should be low. The best assistance you can get is from post docs or fellow students in the same program that truly care about your project and progress. Students and faculty that do not have anything invested in you will not help as much.","It is useful in that it forces you to work on your PQE very early, but the inflexible deadlines make it unnecessarily stressful. Also, being assigned to random sections limits the scientific feedback you receive on your proposal.","The class was well-intended, but I think I didn't get as much out of it as I hoped."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.10","workload":"5.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.10","enrollment":"55","response rate":"65.45","QCourseOverall":{"number":"BBS 330","course_id":"12517","cat_num":"156089","1s":"1","2s":"12","3s":"7","4s":"13","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"BBS 330","course_id":"12517","cat_num":"156089","1s":"2","2s":"18","3s":"9","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
