They challenge you to see the issues from different perspectives and realize just how much \"human\" component goes into each economic decision.","This class was great! A super interesting and unique sociology class that focuses on the economy in an accessible and tangible way. The readings were all really great and interesting, and because the class was quite small we had great, interactive discussions, simulations, and more. Since it was the first year taught here we skipped around on the syllabus a little, but as a result the readings and weekly work were super manageable. Dr. Leah is super approachable, experienced, and interesting, and makes all of the content feel relevant and connected.","Economic Sociology is such an interesting subject for both economics and sociology majors."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
