I wanted to take a seminar that would be intellectually stimulating (something I never learned before), but one I wouldn't die stressing over.\r\nThe teacher is amazing--so open minded, caring, and the perfect instructor; not to mention unbelievably talented! She brought in special guests who are renown experts in their fields and the best part was when we went to see a performance.  \r\nYou do not need any prior dance experience. You are not graded on how well you can dance or how well you can master a style of dancing. The class was a great medium to discover something totally new and out of my comfort zone.\r\nThe class has the ideal balance between actually dancing and discussing the readings.\r\nInitially dancing among strangers, I was happy when we quickly formed a close community through dance. All of us bonded through the class and we still keep in contact and share meals together.\r\nExcellent excellent class! So much fun!","This class is really fantastic.  Lauren is such a kind person and she creates a warm, inviting environment in which I was able to learn more about my classmates and myself.  I've always wanted to learn how to dance but was too shy and self-conscious to take a formal dance class where I'd be among experienced dancers.  This class is the perfect way to explore an interest in dance in a pressure-free environment!  Also this class exposed me to the field of dance studies which I've never had the opportunity to study before.","I would tell future students that it is a lot of fun, especially if you just throw yourself into it without reserve. You will learn a lot about dance history, as well as relevant American history that influences the art, but in a low-stress environment.","Take it! It is an amazing course that will change the way you think about dance and help you gain confidence in your movement capabilities. You will have an amazing time learning about the concepts between artistic movements and dance movements and even more so between social ways of thought and the influence that they had on choreography.","This is an amazing course that truly teaches you about dance, but more than anything about yourself. We all grew as dancers, but also as people, determining our aesthetic, social, cultural and kinesthetic values. This a once-in-a-lifetime class that genuinely opens your mind. It serves as a great break from stressful problem sets and essays, allows your body and mind to connect, and lets you explore space and your body.","This class is an invigorating exploration of the history of dance in the United States. Although the class has a movement portion, it is not so difficult that people without dance experience cannot take the course. The course covers a large variety of movement that has been developed in the United States, through in class choreography and in the readings completed outside of class. The research paper at the end of the semester is a lot of work, but it is another outlet for students to explore their interest in dance, and leads to rewarding results.","A really nice way to fill a freshman fall course if you're worried about having too much work. The exercise is also a good way to combat that freshman 15 (which is a real problem). Lauren is great, and the guest teachers are super fun. I had never taken any serious dance classes before but I never felt uncomfortable and it was really great to learn something completely new. You will find something you love because the course covers so much stuff. I feel even more prepared to bust out dance moves at parties\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6dat ballet tho.","This is a nice, easy Freshman Seminar that is a lot of fun, but you shouldn't expect to learn that much from it.","It is a great class for dancers and non dancers alike. I would really recommend this seminar.","The professor is passionate about the subject matter which made the class passionate about the subject matter.  The research paper in this class, though, was a little bit aggravating.  We had a lot of time to do it, but we weren't really guided along the way (i.e. there was only one deadline in the beginning of Nov by which we had to have five pages of it done).  It would have been useful if we discussed topics a little more or had mandatory conferences with the professor to figure out which direction to go in for the paper.","It's a nice break from the typical class structure. The dancing component is refreshing, and you learn a lot about the history of dance in America."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"1.60","difficulty":"2.60","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"14","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 30y","course_id":"10799","cat_num":"80488","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"7","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 30y","course_id":"10799","cat_num":"80488","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 30y","course_id":"10799","cat_num":"80488","1s":"7","2s":"6","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
