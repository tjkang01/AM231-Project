It provides you with an extensive overview of the subject and teaches basic skills necessary to succeed in the program.","Susan is great and the class gives you an opportunity to meet the Harvard Middle East faculty","As a survey course, this class touches upon a wide variety of subject matter pertaining to the Middle East, which is refreshing but can also give the course a fragmented feel, as it may lack continuity. Exposure to various texts and professors (some of the best in their respective fields) was enjoyable and a fantastic opportunity for those still figuring out what their concentration should be.","If you are unsure of the specific focus you would like to have within Middle Eastern Studies, this course exposes you to a variety of disciplines to explore in your studies."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["I would read Edward Said's Orientalism and other prominent academics like Albert Hourani to be able to place in context some of the texts discussed in the class which aren't necessarily books that haven't had wide exposure to Middle Eastern Studies literature.","Great books.","This class is one of the broadest survey classes you could probably find about Middle Eastern Studies. This is very helpful for a field that is so interdisciplinary.","Substantial reading but you learn a lot about what it is to be a graduate student.","It's fun and you'll learn a lot.","Keep in mind at all times that this class is an exposure to the full range of interests and expertise among Harvard's Middle East-focused faculty. Many of you may not be intrigued in the slightest by the assigned week of, say, anthopology, or pre-modern history. But in a degree program where your focus and trajectory are almost entirely yours to compose, this exposition of some very different approaches to the region we all find so appealing should serve as a valuable dose of perspective.","Very enjoyable class.
