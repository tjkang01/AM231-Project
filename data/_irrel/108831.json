As someone who does not study linguistics, I felt like a million bucks being able to read a language that is very different from any other language I've studied after only a couple weeks in the class. Take the time to re-read lectures and memorize slowly so you're not cramming for the midterm.","I greatly enjoyed this class. For exams, only Ch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122orti\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 grammar\/syntax was tested, and all tested words were provided on the exam which was very helpful. The course is very interesting, and I highly recommend it. I learned a ton, and the course is very eye-opening. It is rather cool to see how the current poetry and Mayan languages resisted centuries of external influences and still reflect what is written on Maya hieroglyphs. If you have any interest in Belize, Guatemala or Mexico and\/or the Maya civilization\/worldview, take this course!","This class is basically divided into two parts: the first half is on Ch'orti' grammar and translating Ch'orti' texts, and the second half is on Ch'olan literatures.  If you aren't interested in grammar, you will probably struggle through the first half, since it's all about learning\/memorizing prefixes and suffixes so we can understand texts.  If you aren't interested in literature\/poetic structures, you will struggle through the second half.  You will get SO much more out of it if you do the readings, especially the second half of the semester, when the lectures are basically discussions of the readings.  Alex's lectures can be dry sometimes, but it's clear that he is very knowledgeable about what he's teaching, and he incorporates some cool things into the class like going through the Mayan exhibits in the Peabody Museum or having students who are currently doing research on Ch'olan languages present on their work."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.60","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 1167","course_id":"139","cat_num":"53933","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 1167","course_id":"139","cat_num":"53933","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 1167","course_id":"139","cat_num":"53933","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
