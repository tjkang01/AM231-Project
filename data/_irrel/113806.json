appreciation and pure fun.","This class is simply fun and enjoyable.  You are learning a lot, but sometimes you don't feel like you are.  Eventually, you will see that you can understand a lot of the language.  Remember that speaking a language is probably the most difficult part when learning a new language so it is importat to try to speak as much as possible in class.","A good introduction to Portuguese, but for native speakers of Spanish, a bit slow.","Take as a 5th class. Fun, easy, educational. Exposure to a new culture.","This class was an extremely painless opportunity to learn the basics of a new language.","Portuguese Ac is a good way to learn a lot of grammar and Brazilian culture relatively fast with a course that is really pretty easy. I had no trouble managing it as a 5th class. I wouldn't worry too much if your Spanish isn't perfect either. The class does a good job of working based on some intuitive things anyone familiar with Spanish should know from the first day of class.","You won't lose your time.","This class is a very nice elective for a senior who wants a light and fun courseload, but still wants to learn something useful.","The instructor, Leticia, is really amazing.","It's occasionally a fair bit of work, but it's well worth it and you'll learn a lot.","This is a good elective but don't take it as a main class if you already speak Spanish because there's too much in common between the languages to make it much of a challenge","Its not necessarily hard but requires a lot of busywork","I'd let them know that it's an excellent course to take as an elective or in preparation for travel in Brazil\/Portugal--very fun, informative, and a great break for paper-writing\/exam-oriented courses.","One of my favorite classes this semester.  The class is extremely interesting and rewarding, I am very proud of the progress I have already made in learning a new language thanks to this class.  Learning a language is one of the most practical skills you can learn in college and what better language to learn!  Brazilian culture is so festive, diverse and unique and learning the language gives you the opportunity of further immersion.","It is a fun class, not hard and you learn a lot. Learning a new language also teaches you another way of learning here at Harvard.","Fun, easy way to learn Portuguese.","Speakers of Spanish can learn a large amount of Portuguese in this one-semester course.","Fantastic elective!","Definitely take it. One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard.","Don't leave work packets until they are due. It's a language class, you learn with practice and you are going to get a lot of it.","loved it","This is a fantastic class.  If you are already a Spanish speaker, this is fun and (relatively) easy.

The staff are amazing, they're respectful, understanding and genuinely kind people. You also really learn the language.","It is worth taking!","Easy, enjoyable class.","The instructor has a true interest in her students and is always looking at the bigger picture in terms of monitoring overall progress rather than dwelling on minutia.","This class is not at all difficult and is a great introduction to Portuguese.  Knowledge of Spanish is extremely helpful.","You'll enjoy it.","It is fun, exciting, and easy if you keep up with your daily work.","The class under the command of Prof Peres was very interactive and enjoyable.  Prof Peres demonstrated a perfect command of the material and a genuine enthusiasm to share her knowledge and a desire to see all students progress.  Last but not least, Prof Peres is always available to questions outside of the classroom and consistantly provides constructive feedback and encouragements while treating all of us with respect and care.","This is an excellent course which specifically targets the problems that Spanish speakers generally encounter while trying to learn Portuguese. Professor Aprobato is an excellent instructor and students will be amazed by the level of language fluency that they develop after just one semester.","You can learn to speak Portuguese.","Take the class with friends so you can figure out assignments because the syllabus is extremely confusing and faculty did not help much.","Taking this course is one of my best Harvard experiences within a classroom.","Great intro to Port.","the workbook exercises were too long and time consuming.","If you are looking to learn portuguese and have basic knowledge of another romance language this is a great class to add on, perhaps as a fifth class as it does not require that much work.","A dynamic and solid class to learn the basics of portuguese.","This class is fun, easy, and you learn a lot of basic Portuguese. It's a total no-brainer for Spanish speakers who want to learn this language."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["Rosario is an enthusiastic teaching fellow with an admirable ability to engage students of different levels.  Her leadership made the course both interesting an productive.","very fun, learn portuguese extremely fast, awesome department","This class made it a joy to learn the language.","This is a great course for learning Portuguese. It is fun however there will be a good deal of practice to be done outside of the classroom. Only take it if you are serious about learning the language and willing the commit, otherwise you will be disappointed with the outcome. You know how it goes, \"you'll get out of it what you put in\".","This is a great, fun, class.  It's not too hard, but you learn such a great skill.  I looked forward to my Portuguese classes every week.","I never thought I could learn so much in one semester. It was amazing.","This class may have been the most enjoyable class I've taken at Harvard. If you do all the required work and have enthusiasm for the subject, you will do well. Especially if you get an instructor like Elena, it will be a joy to go to class each day.","It is a great and fun class where you will at least learn to write and have a meaningful conversation in Portuguese.","Great introduction to Portuguese. Great teacher!","It's fun, you learn a lot, you make friends.","This course is an amazing, stress-free way to pick up a new language, and if your preceptor is Elena, you will also have a wonderful, caring teacher who is great at imparting the material.

Easy and fun and the teachers all love to teach it. Coursework looks at language but also at Brazilian culture which is great.","its an easy class, but has a good deal of busy work\/home work","This was the funnest class I have taken at Harvard. Not only did I learn a new language, but I learned a new culture and had fun at the same time. The work, while not very time consuming at all, is very rewarding and educational. I especially enjoyed the classroom conversations, which were what made the course especially enjoyable.","Practice speaking portugese not spanish!","You will laugh, you will cry. You will rage against the weight of an entire chapter's worth of workbook exercises due the following day because you didn't space them out over the course of the week and a half you normally are given to do them. But you will have a very positive experience.","This class is a painless and fun way to learn Portuguese!","The good think about working in a small class setting is that you get to know your peers really well. Especially since it is a language course, there aren't many \"intellectual\" things you can talk about. You mostly talk about yourself and you life, and that builds some good friendships.","Great class. You will learn a lot. Not too much work at all. Very interesting.","I recommend this course to any student that has studied Spanish - it is a well-designed, well-taught course that uses your Spanish to teach you Portuguese as quickly as possible.  The workbook is long and can sometimes be tedious, but the course overall is relatively easy and you don't realize how much you are really learning.","I would tell them it was a fun way of starting to learn Portuguese and getting exposed to Brazilian culture.","This class is almost embarrassingly easy. If you put in the effort, the opportunity to learn Portuguese very quickly is there. If you don't put in the effort, it's still an easy and enjoyable experience."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["This class is extremely easy. It can become painfully boring though because of the similarity to Spanish. Most of the work can be put off until the last minute. It's a fun class though.","Excellent course","Great way to pick up a new language. The similarities between Spanish and Portuguese are quickly made clear and you will be conversational if you put in the work.","Awesome class, youll learn alot of portuguese very quickly!","This class was very fun and useful. You learn the language very quickly. I would also say that the TF is crucial for the class, because he or she must be able to inspire the class. I was lucky that I changed Tfs because if not I would probably would not have done as well \/ had as much fun in the class.","Such a great class. You will learn so much but never feel like you are learning during the process. It is really fun and allows you to interact with the rest of the students.","Portuguese Ac is so much fun! A really enjoyable class all-around. Building on knowledge of Spanish, you will likely gain proficiency in Portuguese faster than in another language class, and without any stress. Sections in this class are a delight to attend.","This class is awesome! You can learn another language! And Max is one of the most amazing teachers I've had here!","Portuguese is a wonderful language! This course also allows you to learn a lot about Portuguese-speaking countries around their world and their culture.","Fun class, learn quickly","Great introduction, not difficult at all.","This class is so much fun! It was my favorite class this semester. You'll love coming, and you'll also learn a lot of Portuguese.","Max is a very nice and sympathic professor. He engages the students and arouses interest in the topics. Sometimes, however, some sessions are a review and, for one hour of class, it can be a bit tedious if you already kow the material.Still, an uncomplicated class and you end up with some knowledge of Portuguese","If you need an easy class and are interested in learning the language, definitely take it.","You become comfortable with Portuguese language and culture quickly. You will be surprised by how much you learn.","Real talk. Pound for pound one of the most enjoyable classes at Harvard. We actually learn a language. That's true. But you laugh, you cry, you start to speak with the Rio accent. I genuinely looked forward to class everyday and noticed as I became more of a Portuguese speaker. I'm a big fan and believer. I would say if you're thinking about it, do it. Can you speak Spanish? Well there is no reason you shouldn't also know how to speak Portuguese!","Go in ready and willing to delve into the material, then you will get the most out of it!","Take it! This course is great and the whole Portuguese department is wonderful!","Very engaging class.","Visit various sections of the course so you get a good sense of the different teaching styles from the various instructors then choose what style best meets your learning needs. Even attend the first few sections of each. I would not take this course again with the same instructor but I'm sure others were able to benefit from her style. \r\n\r\nAlso, sign up at the tutoring center! It was my most positive experience for the course and it contributed greatly to my improvement in reading, writing, and speaking the language.","You'll get out of it as much as you put in.","Do not even consider shopping for a 2nd class if this is a class you are likely to take. You. will. love. it.","Its a fun class and the interactive design of sections helps you learn Portuguese.","This course is very fun. it can sometimes be disorganized, which can be frustrating, but you will actually learn some Portuguese.","Fun!","I think it would depend on the teacher. Conce\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a3o is very nice, but unless all the students are highly motivated, it's hard to get a lot out of it. The class moves too slowly, and we don't get pushed hard enough.","This class is fantastic. Even though it's not a huge time commitment, I still think I learned a lot. And I had a great time doing it!","The class is really fun, very well run, and you learn a lot in very little time.","Don't expect the pace to be as high as one would infer from the course name, and expect to be treated like your in middle school by both the textbook and the continuous assessment system.","Take this class! You must be willing to study, but it is definitely a class that is worth it.","The course moves at a very manageable pace, the work you do will all help to make you better understand and speak the language, and every teaching fellow I had a chance to interact with was awesome.","If you want to learn Portuguese, take this class. Be aware, however, that the pace of it is pretty slow."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Best class ever! You learn a LOT of Portuguese. I can now understand Portuguese fluently, and can speak it very well, despite having only four months of exposure to the language.","Make sure you have solid understanding of Spanish coming in - it will make the course significantly easier.","This course was a lot of fun and still provided me with the resources to learn a lot about the culture of countries where Portuguese is spoken. It gives you a good foundation of the language and still enables you to learn more about certain topics that interest you.","Very fun class.","It's fun - more fun than any language course I ever took in High School. And I learned a lot without feeling stressed about it.","Portuguese is a class where you don't realize you are learning until you start speaking and recognize how advance you are. Heloisa Galvao is hilarious and will make going to class enjoyable. Please don't leave the licao until the last day. It takes a while!","If you really want to learn Portuguese, you should take the class.  However, it is not very advanced and the claim that it is \"Portuguese for Spanish Speakers\" is a misnomer.","It was my least stressful course and learning a language should be fun. I really liked the teacher and the learning atmosphere he created.","It is too much of a time commitment for the slow pace we moved. People who want to learn Portuguese would probably be better off in a private class.","Portuguese Ac is an excellent course that introduce the language in a fun and interactive manner. Although grammar might have been reviewed a little bit more consistently, the course is a must take.","TAKE THIS CLASS!

It is not very time consuming and if you have a good group of people in your section, it can be a Very fun class.","Very fun and useful class!","This is a very good intro level class for students interested in learning Portuguese.","Students who have a solid background (preferably fluency) in Spanish should definitely consider taking this class to expand their horizons and allow themselves future opportunities with respect to travel and work. Learning Portuguese from Spanish is a logical next step, and the class has a great environment that will make learning the language enjoyable. I did not realize the class was a two-semester-long course (Ac and Ad) going in, but there is also Portuguese Ba for students to consider. This class is a smart and popular choice!","This course is fun and easy. Just do your work, study before exams and you'll be set. It might be a bit stressful in the beginning if you know spanish and are switching to such a similar language but pretty soon you'll be able to differentiate them better.","Portuguese is so easy to learn once you know Spanish well. Brazil's booming economy and the beauty of portuguese itself are both great reasons to learn the language.","Awesome, fun class! There were a lot of workbook exercises, but they're necessary to begin learning a language. The presentation at the end of the course was more fun than I expected and the quizzes\/exams are easy to study for\/do well on. Knowing how to speak Spanish definitely helps you pick up the language quickly.","This class is great. The accelerated pace of the course enabled me to gain a solid grasp of Portuguese in only 3 months!","It's a low-stress course in a fun department. It doesn't require any extraordinary effort. With a Spanish background, you acquire reading fluency pretty quickly.","don't choose heloisa if you want to seriously learn","Get ready to learn and have a lot of fun learning in a very painless manner","It is fun, great, and easy, and could easily be taken as a fifth class. If you desire rigor in language-learning, this is certainly not the place. But it is first and foremost, fun. And I did learn some Portuguese, though it felt like I didn't have to do anything to get there. The workload is negligible.","This class is great fun. You learn a lot and there is not much work. It is a great elective, especially for those seniors looking for a great class to take.","It's a great way to learn another language while exploring Brazilian culture.","The class provides a solid overview and foundation to Portuguese, but it requires initiative and outside practice to get mastery.","Finishing the book work ahead lets you keep up in class.","You will definitely learn a lot and love every moment of it!","This is a great way to have fun, learn and get your foreign language requirement out of the way. Heloisa is delightful","This is a very easy class, but if you are hoping to quickly learn the basics of the language, you might be a bit disappointed. I think that it could have been more intensive and more engaging, so as to provide students with a lot more, after a semester. Getting some extra practice through language tables for instance, would be a great way to complement the experience.","That it is an enjoyable way to fill out your schedule!","The course is great for learning Portuguese! Even though the pace is a bit slow, you will learn the language. Since it is intended for Spanish speakers, the similarities in languages make the course worthwhile and immerse you in Portugu\u00c3\u00aas Brasileiro.","This class is AWESOME. If you're looking for a fun language to take, that's also easy & will be useful, DEFINITELY take this class. You definitely have to make a commitment to complete the work book each week & actually learn the language, but you'll have a lot of fun and learn a lot about Brazillian\/Portuguese culture too. Great class.","This is a great course! If you have previous knowledge of Spanish, this class is actually pretty feasible and not very difficult. It is certainly doable as a fifth class, and section is always fun and entertaining. Although the workload is not very intense, you find at the end of the semester that you have learned plenty!","really fun class, you do learn how to speak pretty well in just one semester, TF was really fun and nice!","Fun and chill class, good introduction into Portuguese. Perfect if taken alongside more difficult courses.","This is a great class. You learn a lot and there's minimal work.","This course will teach you a great deal, but at the same time it is relaxed so that it will not overwhelm you if you have a hectic schedule.","I LOVED this class.

Definitely take if you are interested in the language at all.","Portuguese is an amazing language, and this course is a great way to learn it. While your mileage may vary depending on your section leader, Stephen Bockskay is an excellent teacher.","It's so good, but you're definitely going to want to shop it.  Your TF will make or break the experience.","A lot of people told me I didn't need to take a Portuguese course because I already speak Spanish, but this really helps you get a handle on the pronunciations and more subtle differences between the languages that you need if you don't want to end up speaking Portu\u00c3\u00b1ol!","Great course. There is very little work, but you learn really quickly.","Definitely take it.","This is a great course. All the portuguese instructors are really nice and relaxed and in general, its a really great atmosphere. As with many beginning language classes, you actually have to opportunity to get to know your teacher as well as other people in your class, which I find to be rather rare at Harvard.","You get as much out of it as you put into it. It's the best class I have taken here at Harvard because you learn while having fun.","This was my favorite class I took all semester.  The energy in the classroom and the relatively low workload made this a perfect class to take freshman fall while I was still adjusting to the college learning style.","This is the best class ever. It is manageable, but you really learn a lot. There is not a lot of \"spanish\" in the class, and it's just a basic language class, but a fun one!","What a blast! A beautiful language and a fun, super low-key way to learn the basics of Portuguese.","What you gain from this class, like any language class, will depend on the effort you put forth.","Though this course was salvaged by the fun that I had with classmates, I found myself frustrated by the lack of leadership that my preceptor would take over the course. She was extremely frazzled all the time, often patronizing, and even passive-aggressive with us sometimes. She was visibly stressed all the time and you couldn't ask her a question without sending her into a flurry of stress, which was frustrating, especially when you're asking something extremely basic. Though it was mildly amusing at first and I tend to have a lot of patience, by the end of the semester I was at wit's end in the classroom. Though the language is beautiful, the materials are helpful, and the syllabus is extremely thorough, I think your experience can be completely colored by your preceptor so choose wisely.","A chill way to learn a bit more Portuguese","It is so fun and fulfilling to learn Portuguese, especially if you have a TF like Stephen who is definitely serious about helping us learn the most possible, but still makes sure we have fun and interact with everyone else in the section to facilitate a strong class bond and even more motivation to learn.","Your experience depends on your section TF. It's a fun class and language and not a lot of work.","This is a really fun class.  If you are interested in learning Portuguese and you already are proficient in Spanish, this is the class for you! It was great!","This class is absolutely amazing. It is possibly my favorite class this semester. It was extremely fun and I felt I learned a lot of Portuguese in a short amount of time. I think everyone should take this class.","The class is rather unstructured and moves at a super slow pace (for Spanish speakers, that is). As a result, it may appear to be boring sometimes and it's easy to ignore the regular homework. (don't let that happen!). Otherwise, it's a fairly fun and easy course.","This is class is definitely the best in-class experience I've had at Harvard. Everyone, starting with the instructor (Heloisa in my case), is friendly and eager to help and participate. SO MUCH FUN. And because you feel so comfortable participating, you get the hang of speaking very quickly!","This is the best course ever. You get to learn a beautiful language in an interactive and exciting way. Our section became really close and Luca is literally the greatest human.","Super easy class, and I actually feel like I can speak Portuguese now. Take it, and pray that you get Stephen because he's a boss.","I loved this class and Stephen is the best! I have never studied portuguese before and just in these few months, I have learned so much and I know I can survive if I were to become stranded in Brazil or Portugal. And again, Stephen Bocskay.","Really fun class, while learning something in the process. Definitely take if you are at all interested in Portuguese or learning a new language!","Portuguese AC is so fun and not that difficult!","Take this class! It is fun and interesting and you leave having learned a lot of Portuguese as well as a lot about the culture of Brazil.","This class was one of my greatest experiences at Harvard. The class dynamic and the TF was amazing. I felt very comfortable making mistakes in class and even though I was a little intimidated in the beginning by how fast we were expected to start speaking, I'm really glad it happened. However, this class is still a language class so expect to spend some time trying to learn the material. Knowing Spanish only helps to some degree, but just doing the work is irreplaceable.","If you want a class where you will have fun and  learn Portuguese while gaining cultural knowledge about Brazil and Portugal (especially through music!), and all with a great professor (Heloisa Pedrosa),  take this class!!","Although this class isn't incredibly demanding, if you want to, it can help you learn a lot of Portuguese in just a semester. If you're at all interested in Portuguese or Brazilian culture, this class is worth it.","If you are interested in languages at all, take this class!","Definitely a good class, but sometimes moves too slowly.","Be sure to put in time outside of class to really solidify the language.","This is a wonderful course! Portuguese is a beautiful language, and Portuguese Ac is the perfect course to begin learning the language if you are proficient in spanish. I had Luca as a TF, and he was incredibly energetic! We engaged in dialogue every single class and were able to develop our speaking ability very quickly.","This class is absolutely amazing. It was so much fun and it was pretty easy too. I definitely recommend it for anyone that is looking for a way to liven up their semester.","Do not hesitate to take this class. It was the highlight of my week. I never stopped smiling once I stepped into the classroom and left feeling happy to be learning. It makes learning a new language a fun process through conversational speaking, not rote grammatical exercises, as it should be. If you are interested at all in Brazil, one of the most important rising world powers, then just get started!","Fun course! Portuguese is a beautiful language.","Very fun and enjoyable.","Portuguese is a fun language and the TF's are awesome!","Cross your finger and hope really hard that you get Stephen Bocskay.","Good for getting your base in Portuguese and gets you ready to move on. I recommend it if you are interested and have a solid Spanish background (but you don't really need to be fluent, just approaching fluent).","The course truly was great\/exciting, I just didn't like the lack of organization\/communication on assignment due dates."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This is a great, fun course if you're interested in learning Portuguese. Class is engaging and will definitely help you improve your Portuguese skills. However, it is not organized particularly well, which can be challenging at times and makes it difficult to gauge what is expected of you on assignments. Be flexible though and you can get a lot out of it.","I LOVED this class. Stephen's passion for Brazilian culture and the language permeated our room and got our entire class excited for the material.","Very fun, not too difficult","It is a fun class!","Portuguese was my favorite class this semester. I'm surprised by how much I ended up learning and had a lot of fun doing it. Definitely recommend","I love this class, there is so much opportunities to learn about culture and the countries that speak the language. The work is annoying but nothing that is too much to handle.","You'll walk away with a good idea of how the Portuguese language is constructed, feeling comfortable enough to attempt to speak Portuguese to native speakers. Perfect if you're planning on going to a Lusophone country for study abroad","Serious studying of grammar and vocabulary might be unexpected but definitely necessary.","It's not as easy as some people say it is.","This class is a lot of fun. I would definitely recommend it. Just be sure to stay on top of the material and take it seriously.","This class is effective at teaching basic portuguese. You will learn how to have a real conversation and a little bit about Brazilian culture. Keep up with the textbook readings because it will be obvious in section if you have not studied.","It helps a lot to know the grammar rules of Spanish for this class. There are a lot of terms for grammatical rules in Portuguese that were applied from Spanish, that I was not aware of since I was a native speaker and didn't take a class. It just makes it easier to know, but you can definitely take the class without this knowledge.","This class is not simply a language class...but a portal to understanding Brazilian culture and society. You actually end up learning more about yourself through the open dialogue you have in the course about various aspects of Brazilian life.","This course was the highlight to my day.  Class was always fun and exciting. It felt like I was learning something new during every minute of it.","You will get so much out of this course. The relative time input is quite low relative to the amount that you get out of it. Although it may be easy to cruise by, especially with the Spanish background, try to put a little bit of time in as you can actually speak conversational Portuguese by the end of one semester if you do so. I took it as a 5th class, had a lot of fun every single day, learned a lot, and would do it again in a heartbeat. Having an instructor like Viviane obviously was a huge plus. Seriously, take this if you can.","This class is very fun. Try to get Viviane as your TF. The language is not that difficult to learn if you already speak Spanish.","This class is not difficult for spanish speakers.  I strongly suggest asking yourself why you want to take portuguese before you begin studying it.","You will really enjoy going to class every day and you'll make friends in there while leaning a new language. It's an amazing experience and you'll have great opportunities to visit Brazil as well.","This is a very fun and engaging class. If you are interested in learning more about Brazil or Latin America, you should definitely take it!","This class is AWESOME! I wasn't sure I wanted to switch from Spanish to learn another language but I am so glad I did. The class was extremely relaxed so it was never stressful but by the end of the course I was able to be completely conversations with a group of Portuguese speakers. This is one of the only classes that I knew if I wasn't in a good mood, I would laugh during class at least once and come out feeling better. Harvard needs more classes like that! Definitely take this if you're considering it! And get Tadeu as your TF if he's still teaching!","Your experience in this class depends almost entirely on your professor. Ana Litvin is an amazing professor who really cares about her students.  She consistently puts more effort into the class than she is required to and that is why she belongs at Harvard.  For a truly amazing learning experience you will realize that you want to put in about 6-8 hours per weeks so that things are fresh in your mind when you get to class.","LOVED IT! so fun and I learned so much ! Also, I'm going to Brazil in two weeks so pretty stoked about that as well :D","Really fun class and definitely one of the most useful classes you'll take.","This class is a great introduction to Portuguese for Spanish speakers.","This is a really fun way to spend an hour a day Monday through Thursday. Spanish and Portuguese are so similar that you won't have any trouble at all picking up this new and beautiful language. Take as a 5th! If you were like me and were hoping for something extremely intensive, this is not the course for you. That said, there is no course like that offered right now for Portuguese. So I'd suggest doing what I did: take the course, enjoy a chill semester, and try to supplement with some readings and self-study.","Really fun class where you learn a good amount of beginners portuguese. The spanish speakers aspect isn't a large part of the course at all.","This class is easy and a lot of fun. There is regular work, but it is easy and shouldn't take you too long to complete. The class went much slower in covering material than I expected, but I still learned a lot.","Take this class if you have any spanish experience. Its fun, easy and engaging.","This course is not difficult at all and was genuinely enjoyable. Portuguese is a beautiful language to learn and the opportunities to travel to Brazil are also a plus.","This class was definitely the highlight of my semester. Ana Paula was a phenomenal instructor. She was very friendly, approachable, and truly made an effort to ensure that we were understanding the material. She made a great effort to make the class a fun, immersive experience. Her powerpoint presentations were nicely presented and it was evident that she really invested time in putting the effort to present the material to us in an engaging way. We would often listen to Portuguese music that would highlight the lesson of the week. The class was very interactive and the great group of people in the class only added to the wonderful experience. Having snacks on a daily basis was also a plus!"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["All of the TF's are very supportive; I really recommend learning Portuguese because it opens you up to an incredible culture, including a very friendly group at Harvard.","More work and harder than I thought the class would be. Viviane was fun and caring, but at times I got frustrated with all of the work and lack of organization.","It's very good, dynamic and fun. It is also more work than you would expect for a language class","This class was very Brazilian - great people and super fun, but also super disorganized.","This is a great course! If you want to learn Portuguese and have a Spanish background definitely take this over Port Aa. You don't need to be an amazing Spanish speaker just knowing the grammatical structure of romance languages will help. If anything knowing Spanish pronunciations make it a bit harder to learnt the Portuguese ones. GREAT class and Viviane is an amazing teacher I highly recommend it.","best language class i've ever taken, hands down.","The professor is enthusiastic and makes class exciting, but the course lacks organization. This may change, however, as the professor fine-tunes her course design.","This was a great class that gave me a solid introduction to the similarities, and more importantly, the differences between Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. The activities all had a clear purpose and contributed toward skill development in the class. Exams can be difficult so prepare accordingly.","This class is somewhat disorganized and doesn't go exactly by the syllabus. I had to do a lot of outside work to feel comfortable with the material - the pace seemed frenetic most classes. The utilization of iSites was below average, and it wasn't always clear what assignments were due when. \n\nOverall, this course wasn't the best introduction to Portuguese I think I could've had, but you learn a lot in any case. I think that this has potential to be an amazing class, just a little more organized and it'd be great. I would still strongly recommend if you're interested in Portuguese because Viviane is truly dedicated.","The course with Prof. Legg is excellent. You will learn and enjoy at the same time. It will take around 2-3 hours of your week for doing the assignments but is worthy.","It's a good class. You'll get even more out of it if you put in the time to understand and study the material outside of class, particularly the vocab.","I took this class for a fun elective.  If that's why you want to take this class, I wouldn't recommend it.  Our preceptor did a good job of engaging the class and making you feel comfortable participating, but the organization of the class was crippling.  The hardest part of the homework was figuring out what we had to do on the iSite, which shouldn't be the case.  Assignments would be in random places on the site or not on there at all.  It was also unclear what was actually being graded.  \"Oral tasks,\" for example, made up a large portion of your grade (according to the syllabus), but I did not receive a grade on a single one out of about seven tasks.  In-class activities, too, could be difficult to decipher.  We would get about one minute to complete some task, and I would spend all or most of it trying to figure out what to do, which resulted in a lot less time practicing Portuguese.\nWe politely alerted the course head (also our teacher) that the iSite was a mess, and she got annoyed and defensive, essentially refusing to fix it.  I found this to be unprofessional.  The course did have its exciting moments and I did learn some Portuguese, but in its current state, it brought more unneeded stress than it was worth.","I would recommend the course because it was great and has issues that can be easily fixed.","Benedict Cruz is one of the coolest people youll meet here.","Great class. Took it as an elective and feel like I can converse in portuguese after a semester.","If you speak Spanish and want to learn another Romance language, TAKE THIS COURSE. You won't find a better stepping stone into another foreign language.","Do not take this as a relaxing course and to just learn the language. The course take more time and there is a lot of busy work.","Great class for learning Portuguese.","If you take this class, you will basically get what you put in. You will not be pushed to learned the language as the assignments and tests are doable even without knowing everything or studying too much. If you really want to learn the language though you will have to do some self study. Overall, I think is a fun class and if you get involved in all of the outside activities you will definitely acquire the language faster.","I would tell them to supplement the in-class portion of this course with exposure to the language outside of class.","TAKE THIS COURSE!!! (Workload ~ 3 hours outside class\/week) I knew going into it that my Spanish wasn't at the level of the other students but that didn't stop me. This class is super manageable, and despite the high workload ratings, it isn't tedious like other languages might be, and doesn't really seem like work. Furthermore, you CAN ACTUALLY BE CONVERSATIONAL WITH NATIVE SPEAKERS if you try hard enough- you get out what you put in.","Make sure you and your classmates are on the same page with assignments","This class has a perfect balance of workload and enough engagement to really get you learning the language.","Not the pleasant learning experience that I had hoped for. Needlessly stressful and time consuming. Extremely disorganized; last minute assignments and inconvenient final project. Assignments were returned very late. Costs may outweigh the benefits in taking Ac over Aa. \nDespite these frustrations, this course has tremendous potential. I am hopeful that it will be restructured significantly and make for a better learning experience next year."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This is a great class, especially with Viviane!","This is a great course to get an introduction to the Portuguese language and to learn about pronunciation and grammar.","Get the book for rent or used!!!! We do not use it much during class."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["This class was one of the funnest classes I've ever taken and I'm so glad I took it. I learned so much Portuguese in such a small amount of time and I can actually have conversations with Portuguese speakers. I also feel that I learned a lot about Brazilian culture. I really recommend this class for any Native Spanish speakers because it will have you speaking Portuguese in no time and the class will really brighten up anyone's days. Even though this class was at 9 AM I was always laughing and having a great time. I also get to go study abroad in Brazil this summer because of this class.","Easy course, but as any intro language class it requires lots of little assignments and lots of time commitment.","I felt a bit attacked as a Spanish-speaker. The professor isn't very patient with Spanish, which is difficult when you're constantly comparing the two languages in order to better distinguish them, so I suggest there be a complete turn one way or the other. If I'm constantly comparing Portuguese with Spanish, I'm bound to mix the two a bit, especially in the beginning, which is what this course kind of asks for. In order to really avoid speaking \"portunhol\" I suggest we turn against Spanish in class, and focus on asking students to communicate in English if they don't know a word.","This course is really great in what it's supposed to do: you learn the basics of Portuguese in just one semester, and you can understand many things as well as hold simple conversations in Portuguese. However, be prepared for a lot of homework and activities, as it is quite the intensive course!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"8.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PORTUG AC","course_id":"4443","cat_num":"113806","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PORTUG Ac","course_id":"4443","cat_num":"0430","1s":"4","2s":"20","3s":"22","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PORTUG AC","course_id":"4443","cat_num":"113806","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
