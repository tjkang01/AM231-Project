Best neurobiology tutorials and great professor. Both Helen and Geoff do a great job at teaching the material very well. They are truly very knowledge about the current field of plasticity and synapses. I couldn't have asked for better tutorial, the material is manageable and the professor are always understanding.","This is a great course to take- the subject matter is something that is important for neurobiologists to understand, and for those who aren't neurobio concentrators, the subject matter is interesting for its implication in learning and memory. The course load is quite light, as expected since the course counts as a semester course though it's taken over a year, and because of that it's easy to take 5 courses when taking it(or a 4 course schedule where one of the courses is particularly tough). Helen and Geoff are great, and they're quite flexible in the operation of the class to make it as beneficial for us as possible. Also, you'll get much better at reading and analyzing papers, especially in preparation for your turn to head a discussion and the grant proposal.","Amazing! We laugh so much every class and I have learned so much :) A true gem!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This is such a great course; the half-course over a full year format allows you to take classes that would be a bit difficult to handle when taking 5 entire classes and\/or take a class that might be somewhat hard to manage if when taking 4 entire classes (e.g. Chem 30). The material that you learn is integral to Neuro research and is really cool, and the concepts will equip you to think of ways to address questions that are interesting to you in the mock grant proposal. Helen and Geoff were both awesome, and though they won't be teaching the course next year, whoever takes their place will have good notes on what works!","SO sad this course isn't being offered again but it is amazing! it's a class where you learn because you want to!","AMAZING! Field trips! LAUGHTER ALL THE TIME!!! So much learning and such a great class dynamic :D","This was the best class I've taken in the Neurobio concentration, and possibly at Harvard overall. Helen and Geoff were both amazing, and were more than willing to stay after class or meet up at any point to talk about presentations, concepts, the course, or neuroscience news\/developments.\r\n\r\nTutorial is where you learn to present and read primary lit and nail down neuro concepts, and it's the ideal venue for it: small, intimate, non-scary, and with tutorial leaders who are really willing to help you when you're stuck. \r\n\r\nRecommended with enthusiasm!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"1.60","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hfg","course_id":"11067","cat_num":"43391","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hfg","course_id":"11067","cat_num":"43391","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hfg","course_id":"11067","cat_num":"43391","1s":"2","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
