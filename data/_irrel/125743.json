Professor Johnson is really astute and a fantastic resource if you come to office hours. The in-class discussion this year was not very good, though.","A sublime sampler of some of the finest writing ever wrought.","Great course, great readings. Have a good year or two of grounding in literature. Lack of this will make your time more difficult when it has to be, as discussion is fast-paced and high-level. Johnson is witty and passionate, but can often dominate the discussion in absence of student participation. He can also be frustratingly open-ended if you're not used to finding your own direction of analysis.","If you are interested in this subject you will love this course.","As stated above, the class was a great success in the weeks that offered sustained looks at individual essayists and on theoretical approaches to the essay. These weeks allowed us to think about how a certain essayist was situated in time and responded to his\/her historical circumstances. The class struggled in discussions of comparative readings, esp. when the readings came from vastly different time periods and places (so, for example, the Auerbach and Weil week worked better than the Thoreau\/Rousseau\/Carson finale).","It is my understanding that Professor Johnson will not be at Harvard next year. That is a great loss to future students, as Professor Johnson is an excellent teacher and scholar. He will be missed.","carve out some time for the readings!","Great readings and a very interesting professor. I wish the class size had been smaller.","The material picked out by Johnson was strong\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI was exposed to a constellation of great essayists and writers that I plan to further explore outside of class. While the reading assignments often required more time than I was able to commit, the essay assignments were entirely reasonable. The grading was very fair, and Johnson's feedback was carefully crafted. \r\n\r\nThe major weakness of the class was its discussion component. Conversation often veered into gratuitous abstraction\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso much so that at points, it felt as though we were ignoring the content of the essays entirely. I often wished Johnson would interject and steer the conversation away from these abstract themes, but we usually just treaded deeper into intertextuality and abstraction."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.12","workload":"2.25","difficulty":"2.75","recommendation":"4.06","enrollment":"17","response rate":"94.12","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LITER 108","course_id":"598","cat_num":"28173","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"6","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LITER 108","course_id":"598","cat_num":"28173","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"10","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LITER 108","course_id":"598","cat_num":"28173","1s":"0","2s":"12","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
