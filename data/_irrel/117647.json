the topic and only if you have the pre-requisites, or else it will not be worth it.","Tutorials are a great way to have a more leisurely, but nonetheless closer look at a single topic within a field.","Taking a tutorial is a great way to really absorb yourself in one area of mathematics.

It's also great to have a grad student as a professor. The small size allows the course to be fit well to the students taking it.","The tutorials are a great way to see high-level stuff in a low stress environment.

The class is small and the tutorial leader is easily approachable, so you can learn comfortably at a nice pace.","Morse theory tutorial with Boyu was a great class. Morse theory is a really cool topic in differential topology that gets passed over in the standard courses. The ideas all have intuitive pictures behind them and made me realize why many of the big theorems in math 132 are useful. Boyu's lecture were very clear and concise.","Have to be motivated to learn stuff outside of class.","Math 99r was a fantastic experience!  The small class size made it conducive to learning, and was is a great opportunity to learn about modern areas of research.  Konstantin was a fantastic teacher!","The tutorials are a good way to learn an interesting topic in depth. Very casual, laid back format.

I thought the class would be much slower-paced than it actually was, and there were not great resources to help aid in my understanding of the material. I love mathematics, but this was unfortunately a very poor academic experience for me.","Every math student should take at least one tutorial as an undergraduate. They are fabulous.","Group Cohomology is an amazing mix of algebra and topology with some extraordinary applications. Though it is rather hard to learn heavy homological algebra from a lecture. Meng is wonderful!","Campbell was an amazing teacher. He truly cared about the students and made sure we were able to understand the material. It was clear that he was a little frustrated that the overall caliber of the students in the class was not quite high enough and hence couldn't go a bit faster. Regardless, the lectures were excellent, psets were well constructed, and Campbell was an awesome. I can not think of a better way to have learned category theory!","Tutorials are awesome--learn great material at low stress!","I took 'Group Cohomology' with Meng Guo. The material isn't super hard if you are familiar with some homological algebra or maybe algebraic topology. But I didn't have enough motivation for defining or computing group cohomologies, and this made the whole theory look a bit artificial. The lectures were generally good, and the best thing about a tutorial is that the atmosphere was a lot more relaxed than other lectures. I recommend every math concentrator to take at least one tutorial.","Justin Campbell is a great lecturer and category theory is a very interesting subject! The course is super chill and Justin is very helpful (he posts pset solutions and gives comments).
