The teacher is fantastic, one of the nicest people I've ever met. And my writing improved a lot with her help.","Always ask for Margaret's feedback-- she is very very responsive and helpful.","Margaret is an amazing preceptor!  She gives excellent feedback on all assignments, and is extremely fair.  She seemed to care so much about all of my work and wanted me to do the best work possible.  She was always willing to meet outside of class and talk about my essay ideas.  This course as a whole was great too.  The readings and films were very interesting and exciting.","Engage in the material and have fun writing essays using movies and television series.","Course material is excellent and Margaret is an amazing teacher. Highly recommend.","This is a great way to fill your Expos requirement. Margaret is wonderful and provides really amazing feedback. It is a lot of writing, but that's unavoidable due to the nature of the requirement. The responses are easy, but take them seriously and you'll be much better prepared for each paper. Otherwise you'll have to go do all the legwork in reverse. I'd definitely recommend this class. Margaret makes the fun material even more interesting, and keeps the class in a good mood.","Amazing preceptor and interesting material\u00e2\u20ac\u201d2 most important things when choosing an Expos class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"5.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"15","response rate":"86.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
