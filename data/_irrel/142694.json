Highly recommended for anyone interested in history.","Provides a very extensive look into English Legal History.  Details are sometimes overwhelming, however the course was an enjoyable one overall.","Make sure you know what you are getting into.","If you are considering law school, if you are interested in English History, if you are interested in legal history, or you want more experience in close reading of primary materials, TAKE THIS COURSE. If you feel you cannot keep up with the material, or do not have enough interest, then do not."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This is a terrific class.  Professor Donahue clearly cares a lot about his students and puts a lot of effort into the class. Shane, if he is still teaching it, is a god among TFs. The course is not time consuming, but it is quite challenging.  It will provide you with an interesting perspective on the origins of the Anglo-American legal tradition.  Plus, Prof. Donahue's no-nonsense emphasis on primary sources will make you a better historian and thinker."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["This is a great class. If you are interested in the topic I would definitely take it.  Professor Donahue provides the most detailed and helpful feedback on your work- by far the best of any professor I've ever had.  This provides a great opportunity for you to improve on your work- something missing in a lot of courses."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"6.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MEDVLSTD 117","course_id":"3511","cat_num":"5468","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MEDVLSTD 117","course_id":"3511","cat_num":"5468","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MEDVLSTD 117","course_id":"3511","cat_num":"5468","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
