Elsie is a great teacher and the information is very interesting! The final project also allows you to pursue something that you are interested in a see a slice of the work that mercury scientists do!","This is a very engaging course for anyone who is interested in the social and technical aspects of mercury as an environmental pollutant. This course is different (in a good way) in the emphasis it puts on the issues of today and specific challenges of the future. There is a fair amount of technical information that you need to understand for the course, but it is all in the service of understanding broad real-life issues.","The course is a cool way to be introduced to topics ranging from mercury biogeochemistry to epidimiology and risk assessment. Elsie and Helen are great."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"2.60","recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENG-SCI 169","course_id":"5289","cat_num":"59143","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENG-SCI 169","course_id":"5289","cat_num":"59143","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENG-SCI 169","course_id":"5289","cat_num":"59143","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
