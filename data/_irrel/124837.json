You must definitely take this class if you want to become a Qing historian.","it is hard to find another place for Manchu study. this class makes the study not that difficult.","Initially it's a lot of work (learning to read, figuring out grammar), but after getting used to the language, it's a lot of fun. I'm amazed at what we are able to read and translate just after one semester."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Do it.","Manchu is becoming increasingly important as a language for historians of the Qing (and perhaps even for people in other disciplines studying that period), and it would be a shame to fail to take advantage of being at a university that offers instruction in it. Plus, Manchu is a ton of fun to learn, with a cool script and ridiculous sounding words (and in what other language would you learn the word for mounted archery in the first month?)."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Take it! It's a blast. It's fun. It'll be educational. Admittedly, you should probably only take this if you have a specialized interest that somehow relates to Manchus\/the Qing, but regardless, a good thoroughly educational time was had by all.","Very enjoyable class especially if you are interested in using Manchu academically. Beware te script is quite difficult at first but you will get used to it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"4.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"4","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MANCHU A","course_id":"905","cat_num":"8961","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MANCHU A","course_id":"905","cat_num":"8961","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MANCHU A","course_id":"905","cat_num":"8961","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
