If you are a liberal thinker you will love this course and if you are not you should take it anyways to provide a different perspective.","This class is a fascinating one. Patrick Hamm really makes you think about inequality and poverty in a new way. I wish the class were a bit more organized and that the final project, (which is the only assessment you'll get the whole course), were more reflective of things you studied in the course.","Kamilah and Prof Hamm are awesome. They keep their lectures very interesting, and they are very personable. The class material was interesting, which I believe is because of the teaching staff. For example, when we were learning about homelessness, we actually had a panel of 3 homeless people that Prof Hamm met come in to talk to us.","This course is a great way to engage in debates about social theory with your classmates as the lectures are somewhat incendiary, which makes for a fun environment. However at the same time the class lacks rigor (claims made by the professor, who has a very open stance towards the issues, which is cool, are supported with very little), and it can be disappointing that lectures don't necessarily flow together or build on each other. Don't take it if you don't like discussing social theory in class, that is where this course really adds value, other than that it is basically a presentation of the Professor's views, which lie far outside the mainstream and are not well supported by even his own evidence (that's just my opinion of course!)","good course","Take this class with an open mind.","This was by far one of the most memorable classes I have taken at Harvard and the most relevant to real world issues. Although mostly one sided, the course presented a lot of valid arguments on a breadth of issues that definitely changed my perspective on a lot of issues and forced me to consider the world & economy through an entirely different lens.","An easy way to get a sociology class under your built or to get a faint glimmer of economics and markets, however I do not think I learned as much as I could from this class. I think if lectures were less scattered, i'd have had a better opportunity to have this.","Although the depth of each topic may not be deep enough, the ideas and discussion are interesting and thought-provoking.","a must take class","take this course and do the readings","Fascinating topic and readings, and a couple of amazing lectures.  Otherwise, very disorganized.","it is not about how to make money","This class should be called \"an introduction to Patrick Hamm's view of the world.\" I enjoyed it because it's a perspective that you don't hear articulated very often.","The class is very relaxed and the workload is very manageable.  Students are really allowed to debate and state their opinions, and the lectures always had me thinking critically afterwards.","Interesting but kind of all over the place. You get a lot out of reading other students blog posts.","Very very highly recommend this course, the best course ever i have had before.","This class uses the assumption that Capitalism must done away with as the foundational principle. All other topics build off this. The professor is really passionate about his subject, and you should be prepared to debate the topics in class. I learned a lot because I was interested in a particular topic that wasn't necessarily covered in the readings or in class with regard to inequalities. But the class as a whole is a good overview of the Marxist perspective and gives you a sense of the basic types of solutions to the problems caused by Capitalism.","it goes against everything you've learned to believe is right, but has very compelling arguments as back up.","This course is awesome. Extremely chill with really interesting content. The professor really makes you think about various issues and he really shakes things up. VERY manageable workload, as well.","A very fun, provocative course!","Thought-provoking, with some answers - but not all.","come ready to defend your opinions","Unusual, but very interesting course. Fair grading and the final projects are fun to write!\r\nThe lecture on homelessness was the best at college so far!","This class had so much potential given its great subject matter, but by the end of the course I had some major buyer's remorse. However, one highlight of the course was the group project that I had an opportunity to work on. But after a semester of dull lectures and unproductive sections, the only insight that this class gave me was that Capitalism as an economic system is flawed\u00e2\u20ac\u201das if I didn't know that already.","Take this course if you want a fresh perspective on a pertinent issue. It will challenge you to think more critically about the world around you.","This class is an easy and interesting way to learn about different facets of inequality and to expose non-Sociology concentrators to important topics in the field -- in a fun and interactive way!","This was my favorite class all semester hands down. The minimal number of tests and written assignments made the class much more relaxed and allowed me to focus on the fascinating material being covered in lecture and in the readings. In lecture, Professor Hamm provides well-rounded perspectives on how social inequalities function within the capitalist system and potential ways in which inequalities can be addressed. He was very prepared and open to discussion on any of his remarks, which I think is indispensable in class that often touches upon social and financial topics, and which can quickly become personal. And the final project was thorough but not overwhelming. It was a great way to synthesize all of what we had discussed during the semester."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.76","workload":"1.36","difficulty":"1.93","recommendation":"4.07","enrollment":"64","response rate":"90.62","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOCIOL 149","course_id":"4663","cat_num":"19398","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"16","4s":"21","5s":"15"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOCIOL 149","course_id":"4663","cat_num":"19398","1s":"18","2s":"26","3s":"14","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOCIOL 149","course_id":"4663","cat_num":"19398","1s":"39","2s":"17","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
