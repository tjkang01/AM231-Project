Don't expect a sweeping, thorough overview of all methods though.","This is a very good class for expos. It was interesting when we talked about the effect of social media on social revolutions. Towards the end of the course, however, we talked more about fringe democratic proposals like liquid democracy that go a little boring.","Not the most exciting of the Expos selections in terms of content\/reading selections, but the preceptor is very, very knowledgable and has a lot of good advice\/suggesions on how to improve your writing style.","The class is not bad and is a reasonable class for fulfilling the expos requirement, but the material is really dry if you're not interested in the nitty-gritty aspects of government and democracy. Other expos classes could be better, but this class was definitely not the worst.","Democracy in the Digital Age is a fantastic choice. Yascha is a brilliant writer and a great guy. He makes an effort to get to know every student personally, and will work with you one-on-one to improve your writing. For each of the three papers you'll write in this class, Yascha will sit down with you for informal conferences in a caf\u00c3\u00a9 to guide you through the process. If you're at all interested in technology, government, or the intersection between the two, this class is a thought-provoking, enjoyable way to fulfill your Expos requirement.","If you're interested in government you will really like this course.","Make sure that you're very interested in government, and don't expect too much focus on technology.","Take this course if you want a good Expos experience! The essays are difficult but rewarding, the readings are good, and Yascha is awesome.","Yascha is an awesome teacher and I would definitely recommend it. The first part of the course is fairly boring because it focuses entirely on democracy and nothing about technology but the rest of the course is extremely interesting. I definitely believe I am a far better writer after this class.","Yascha is a great teacher who leads lively discussions. Definitely take this if you have an interest in politics\/government: do much of the class is spent on it it might as well count as a gov class. However, don't expect your writing to improve leaps and bounds, especially if you don't put full effort into the class. Definitely take this class if you already have strong political beliefs: you will have the opportunity to argument your political opinions."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"5.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"15","response rate":"86.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.274","course_id":"12342","cat_num":"99038","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"6","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.274","course_id":"12342","cat_num":"99038","1s":"1","2s":"9","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
