I have finished it with a good understanding not just of the course material but of the wider questions surrounding the applicability of the methods, their limitations and their strengths.","This course will make digital methods accessible.","Donald provides very detailed instructions and useful in-class exercises for various topics and applications of digital methods. The workload is moderate, and not too much programming skills are required in this course. Highly recommended to students of Chinese studies in both humanities and social sciences.","If you are working materials related to modern China or pre-modern China, this course is highly recommended!!!!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"5.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"11","response rate":"81.82","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHNSHIS 202","course_id":"13962","cat_num":"161272","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHNSHIS 202","course_id":"13962","cat_num":"161272","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
