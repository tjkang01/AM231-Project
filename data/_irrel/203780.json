Professor Arnold-Biucchi is very kind and a pleasure to work with!  It is not much work at all and the class meetings are very laid back with conversation and observation of coins.  There are no exams, just some manageable papers.  I am so glad I took this class and would encourage anyone from any discipline to go for it and enjoy all the fun!","This class is essentially book club. We get together once a week, look at great coins from the Harvard collection and hear a leading expert in the field tell us all about them. I highly recommend this course!","The Harvard coins collection is incredible, and Professor Arnold-Biucchi is the best person to present it. Coins are a great primary source for learning Ancient History as well!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"3.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"10","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
