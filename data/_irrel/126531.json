The vocab and grammar you learn this semester is very useful. Highly highly recommend.","the hebrew dept. at harvard is excellent. osnat and irit are both fabulous.","A fun class, you learn a lot about israel through television, songs, literature, etc. Very up to date and modern."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Great class, great teacher, and great learning opportunity. Totally worth it!","Osnat is very kind and a joy to speak with. You will hear yourself improving after every conversation with her.","This is overall a very fun and interesting class. I have to caution: I don't know how much this class will improve your verbal fluency, but it will be enjoyable!","This class was a great way to maintain and increase Hebrew proficiency and spend time with an amazing Hebrew instructor, Osnat!!!!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This course is a great way to learn to conversationally speak the Hebrew language and feel comfortable reading and analyzing tough prose and poetry. You will also learn a lot about Israeli culture and history.","I could not recommend this class more highly! It is a really extraordinary experience -- it is both fun and you will learn a lot of Hebrew. My level of speaking, reading, and writing increased dramatically and I always looked forward to class. One way to measure the progress you can make is this: I had some Hebrew reading material in my room all year. Before this class, I was not able to understand it. By the end, I could read through it with almost no help from the dictionary. The class had a similar effect on my reading and writing. Osnat is a special teacher and this class is completely worth every minute -- it is so empowering to master Hebrew in the way in which this class allows you! Take it!","The atmosphere is great; the course teaches you a lot, and you get to practice Hebrew while learning about Israeli culture."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["Osnat is great and the class is interesting","Osnat is amazing. The hebrew class becomes a community, and you learn a ton from being in this class. There is frequent feedback on written assignments and you get to produce some longer works for a mid-semester and end of semester essay\/project. I would highly recommend this course to anyone consider taking hebrew. Never have I had teachers who were so caring, thoughtful and flexible, truly wanting to work with students to improve their hebrew but also acknowledging their lives more broadly.","This class is fantastic!!! You should absolutely take it. Osnat is so nice, and extremely flexible with deadlines when she knows you're having a bad week. My writing and reading improved a huge amount this year. This semester was definitely a lot more work than last semester though (but still entirely reasonable).","Great class."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["Prof. Aharony and Osnat are, by far, the most concerned, caring, and critically engaged instructors I have had at Harvard. Prof. Aharony is the consummate pedagogue: she knows that all four areas of language learning must be addressed, she composes broad yet deep syllabi, and she exudes a happiness for student engagement that makes her a real diamond in NELC's crown. Osnat as well shares Prof. Aharony's capacity for generating enthusiasm among students, presenting the materials in a fashion that integrates all levels of learners equally during class discussion (very difficult to master this skill!), and she provides detailed and concerned feedback on work.","Osnat is amazing and the class is just a really great way to spend 3 hours a week, learning about Israel and having interesting discussions in Hebrew. There's definitely work but it's interesting and never felt like a chore.","To take it!","Osnat is a wonderful instructor who brings everyone into the class discussion. You will be given a lot of new vocabulary; whether you absorb it all or not is up to you."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["This was a great class. We learned both Hebrew and also about Israeli history. Osnat was a great and patient teacher.","Osnat is wonderful. It's great practice speaking and writing Hebrew and the workload isn't too demanding"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MOD-HEB 130B","course_id":"3839","cat_num":"126531","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MOD-HEB 130b","course_id":"3839","cat_num":"28788","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MOD-HEB 130B","course_id":"3839","cat_num":"126531","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
