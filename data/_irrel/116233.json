Also it's fun and a good way to secure your Italian.","Chiara is a wonderful teacher, the plays are a lot of fun to read and act out, the assignments aren't too hard, the exams are easy if you read and know the plays.  It's a great class, with a very relaxed and friendly teacher\/environment.","the course is a little disconnected (one play to next) but overall a lot of fun and you get good practice in your Italian. Also, you have to perform a real play at the end! (while I really enjoyed the play, I hadn't realized it would be such a big production and that we'd have to perform in front of an audience)","It's really easy and absolutely no work - and performing the plays are fun!"]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["Professor Frenquelluci is amazing! I loved this class!","It's a very fun way to learn Italian.","It's a lot of fun, the professor is really nice, it's not too much work","If you're not shy and like theater (and, naturally, Italian), this class is for YOU!","This course is really fun and Professor Frenquellucci is enthusiastic, very helpful, and has a great personality.","This class is a fun way to continue practicing Italian and get exposure to Italian theatre. You have to be willing to perform in front of your class as well as a bigger audience; the class isn't fun unless everyone is willing to put themselves out there."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["SO MUCH FUN! TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT.","It is a amazing class! The teacher is brilliant and the readings are great!","Great, fun, great professor","This class is great. It is so much fun, and it is a great opportunity to focus on speaking in Italian.","Though the whole theatre thing may sound a little strange, as it did to me, take a chance and try out the course. It was actually fun and just as I suspected, you don't feel stupid doing the acting-type exercises because the whole class has to do it so it's fine.  You may even discover that you have some hidden acting talent ;)","It's a really fun way to learn Italian and it will get you speaking much more than any other class!"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Chiara is awesome!!  You will have fun producing a play","This class is enjoyable and really helps with how you will be able to communicate in Italian","It's a lot of fun and not terribly challenging. Your spoken Italian will get a lot better."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["The class is really fun, and should be taken as an elective or fifth class. It will help improve your speaking skills and pronunciation. Patrizia is fabulous!","This a great and really fun class. Your pronunciation really improves.","At points, I wish there had been a little more structure, but overall the class was fun and pretty easy.","Not very serious, but enjoyable","Italian speaking skills are SO important. This is a wonderful course and Patrizia is a great teacher. Very fun\/small class.","It is great that the course is conducted entirely in Italian. Patrizia is a great teacher and offers great insight into the language and culture, and is also laid back."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["It's pretty neat and relatively laid-back compared to my experience of Italian 30. You learn important things like pronunciation and you get to act in a play - which can be pretty fun!","Ital 40 is great course for students looking to work on their speaking skills."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["I would say that some of the pronunciation is difficult to follow, but that the final project makes the class worth the time, effort and difficulty.","If you love to speak before others and work on your speaking skills this is a great class!","Requires a willingness to participate and put yourself out there, especially because this class is usually quite small (mine was 4 people)","Great course to work on your Italian pronunciation! Patrizia is very enthusiastic and helps create a very comfortable environment where you're not afraid to make mistakes when you speak. One can tell that she places a lot of effort!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Italiano 40 is a great class. Patrizia is great, and you'll see your Italian starting to improve after the first few classes! It's a bit of hard work in the beginning, but the effort is so worth it by the end of the semester when you perform!","This class is great!! I never learned as much Italian in a single course before. It made it so speaking is no longer a problem. Also, don't sweat it if you fear acting. You don't act until the very end anyway and you will only get as big a part as you want. The play is totally in the students' hands and it's fairly low stress.","Professoressa Rodomonti is an absolutely wonderful teacher who engaged all of us and encouraged us all to come out of our shells and simply speak. I feel that my pronunciation and my speaking improved vastly during this course, as well as my confidence about speaking and performing in general. It's an incredibly diverse and fun course and even though I'm not an actor, I had a lot of fun throughout the entirety of the course."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Great, laid-back course. You'll significantly improve your manner of speaking Italian and the \"Italian\" in you.","Italian 40 was an amazing course. It can be a nice break from heavy paper\/pset courses that you might have. The course is very speaking heavy, and you learn most of the material just by listening to Italian being spoken around you. The first half of the course centers around reciting monologues, while the last third focuses on a final theatrical performance. I highly recommend taking this course, as the speaking\/acting portions can be a nice break from typical courses.","TAKE THIS COURSE. Marco is a fantastic instructor, and engages the students such that they actually want to participate in class. This is crucial for a language course, as the actual speaking is what causes improvement. Plus, a lot of fun and interesting monologues are read as a part of the course, and the final project is incredibly entertaining."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This is a good class that will improve your pronunciation and make you more aware of Italian theater and culture.","I loved this class! This time around it was small- 5 students, 2 of whom were audits, which gave everyone lots of time to speak and improve. The assignments are not super lengthy and your speaking will indeed improve of you spend enough time reading out loud and listening to what your TF has to say! Patrizia is leaving so I'm not sure who will teach this class the next time around, but for sure take it!"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Be prepared for some frustration at first when your pronunciation is nit-picked, often in front of your fellow students. You'll get used to it soon enough, and before long you'll find that your recitation has improved significantly.","Italian 40 is great! Prof. DiFabio is so engaging and thoughtful, and she structures the class to focus on improvement with the freedom to take risks rather than anything too intimidating. If you're not interested in performing short pieces of literature, you might not love this class, but Prof. DiFabio helps you to learn a lot while you bring these pieces to life. There's an unfortunate handful of reading comprehension assignments on linguistics (in Italian), but overall, the course is fun, the professor is helpful, and it's worthwhile to learn about pronunciation, oral performance, and great Italian literature all in one.","It's a great way to practice your Italian if you're shy about your Italian speaking skills. Professoressa Di Fabio is amazing, and I would highly recommend the class.","Italian 40 might seem intimidating because it requires performing or presenting in front of other people in a language that is not one's own. Still, definitely take it if Professoressa DiFabio is teaching it. This course has been one of the more transformative for me personally because it put me outside of my comfort zone but enabled me to grow from that experience, and isn't that what education is really about?"]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["The class's focus on spoken Italian is really helpful in developing fluency, and the professor is wonderful. I would highly recommend the course."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["This class is a great next step in your advancement of the Italian language.","It's fun, engaging, and diverse! You'll get very close with your TF and classmates while learning about Italian rhetoric and culture.","Italian 40 is a fun and really rewarding course. By the end of the class I really felt like I could speak Italian with clarity and emotional emphasis that I didn't have before. Studying monologues from throughout Italian literature was also a highlight, and putting on the performance at the end of the class offered a nice change of pace. Loved being in a small setting too.","If you're looking for a class that will totally immerse you in the Italian language, this isn't it. But if you do want a more relaxed approach to learning about famous Italian writers, this is a great course. If you're into linguistics, this is also a very interesting course and it definitely helped my pronunciation."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This class has a lot of potential to be a really great class. I've always found regional dialects to be one of the most interesting parts of the Italian language, and dialects are discussed to a certain extent. The course is, however, fairly disorganized so it's sometimes unclear what the expectations are and sometimes I wasn't clear on what we were supposed to be learning. The material itself, though, can be very interesting, especially if you want to know how to determine where an Italian is from based on their accent\/pronunciation.","Be prepared to do a lot of work in short periods and be self driven.","The upper level language classes are wonderful because you move beyond lecture in which you are taught grammar rules and start having conversations about truly interesting things.  This course helps with a number of different things, especially pronunciation and performance, and I really loved it."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["This class was absolutely amazing! It honestly made my semester. Yes, there will be ton of work, but at the end of this course you will be fluent in speaking and be able to write an essay in Italian.","If you want to develop your language skills at a rate comparable to immersion programs in Italy, Chiara's art-centric Italian 40 will do that...and more!","I have nothing but great things to say about this class. I loved exploring the Harvard Art Museums each week and learning about the Italian language through art. I loved the intimacy of the small class setting. And, Chiara is an amazing teacher. It's not easy, but really rewarding.","If the class continues to be about Caravaggio, definitely take it!! You will develop a wide range of vocabulary to describe works of art as an art critic\/historian would - a valuable skill to have as an undergrad. The readings and films are interesting, and of course songs by Giorgia will never be forgotten."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"8.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ITAL 40","course_id":"4421","cat_num":"116233","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ITAL 40","course_id":"4421","cat_num":"0804","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ITAL 40","course_id":"4421","cat_num":"116233","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
