Eric as a talented instructor rewrote all the grammar points and condensed them in a highly efficient and accessible format which were very helpful for learning. With many chances to engage with passionate classmates and beautiful cultural elements of the Uyghur people, this course was truly a blast.","Uyghur is a lot more useful than you might think! There are tons of cognates in other languages, and a thorough understanding of a grammatical system different than one's native language is always good."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This course is a very rare opportunity to study Uyghur and to establish a working knowledge of the most essential grammar and vocabulary. While the language will certainly take many years to master, this course is rigorous, well-structured, and successful in providing a solid foundation for everyday conversation and further study of the language for research projects.","This course is the exemplar for what a language class should be. Eric is an extremely enthusiastic teacher who knows the Uyghur language intimately, and his use of the communicative method was extremely effective. In addition, the Uyghur language is beautiful, fun, and surprisingly easy to pick up, once you get the hang of it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"UYGHUR B","course_id":"917","cat_num":"5271","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"UYGHUR B","course_id":"917","cat_num":"5271","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"UYGHUR B","course_id":"917","cat_num":"5271","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
