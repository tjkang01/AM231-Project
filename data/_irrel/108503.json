Like everything, you get out of it what you put into it. The extraordinary thing was that the material is so interesting, that students (myself but also my colleagues in seminar) poured over the readings and even went beyond the required readings in deepening reflection on areas that were of particular interest. The class really inspires you to engage with the material in a deep and challenging way -- this was my favorite class of the semester and a highlight of my time at Harvard.","Ritualization is how we cope with an uncertain and fragmentary world. Play is how we make meaning . Transitional phenomena are ever-present."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.33","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 1095","course_id":"5048","cat_num":"53269","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RELIGION 1095","course_id":"5048","cat_num":"53269","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 1095","course_id":"5048","cat_num":"53269","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
