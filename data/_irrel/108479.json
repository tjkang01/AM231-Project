It is somewhat nebulous and unstructured, although I could see that improving in a future offering.","This class was disorganized and the discussions were not very effective. The topics of the course are interesting, and you'll see human rights history in a new way (Prof. Moyn's perspective). However, as an undergraduate history course, I'm not sure how much it accomplished.","This is a very interesting and pretty unusual class. It will probably be most rewarding if you come in with your own full-blown theory of the history of human rights because Prof. Moyn presents primarily his own narrative and then asks the class to challenge him. However, even without that it's pretty valuable, and introduces you to the intersection of law and history in a fascinating field without asking too much of your time.","This class is great! It challenges your understanding of human rights and you get to read a bunch of really cool literature."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.64","workload":"2.18","difficulty":"3.27","recommendation":"3.73","enrollment":"12","response rate":"91.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1329","course_id":"2417","cat_num":"21141","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1329","course_id":"2417","cat_num":"21141","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1329","course_id":"2417","cat_num":"21141","1s":"1","2s":"7","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
