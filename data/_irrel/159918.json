He helped me think through my thesis question, and gave great advice about going about data collection. His feedback throughout the process was effective and helpful. He was willing to meet outside the scheduled time slots and I left every meeting with a strong sense of direction and next steps. He was an invaluable resource, mentor and friend during the thesis journey.","It's nice to do a thesis, you feel good about it after."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"8.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"9","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 985PB","course_id":"13725","cat_num":"159918","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 985PB","course_id":"13725","cat_num":"159918","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
