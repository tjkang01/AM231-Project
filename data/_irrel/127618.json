Roy is an excellent lecturer, and the material is fascinating--however, the class is very short, and you won't come away with a newfound mastery of population genetics if you didn't come in with one to begin with.","Understand the big picture instead of the equations.","The course is great! It covers most of population genetics in 2 weeks.","This course is good to get an overall view of evolutionary process. Nevertheless, it goes quite fast on many of them and might not be considered deep enough for many students."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["You will learn a lot and the workload is low. Roy Kishony is leaving so I don't know who will be teaching this class after 2014 and if it will be different.","The course is unstructured, but the professor and TA are very open to questions. Because of the disorganization, some times it is difficult to connect the different topics and themes.
