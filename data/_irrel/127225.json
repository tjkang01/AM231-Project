Her work is current and on-going, so if you're interested in the topics, the course will be a great choice."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Maria is an incredibly supportive teacher.  The course was very laid back but we learned a lot about behavioral genetics in flies and mice.  The guest lecturers helped to tie what we learned about aggression to other species (including voles and humans).  Take it!!","Definitely take this course!  The neurobiology tutorials are really special opportunities to work with fascinating professors, and Maria de la Paz Fernandez is very accessible and a great teacher.  The yearlong format of the tutorials are conducive to very comfortable and intimate discussions, and the weekly workload is pretty low.  Take a look at the syllabus, and if the articles sound interesting to you, then this is a really great way to fulfill an upper level Neurobio requirement.  Furthermore, we were able to go over to Maria's lab and we also had some great guest lecturers."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Take this class. Maria is amazing.","Great neuro tutorial, even for those without a strong neurobiology background. You will learn how to analyze papers well and enjoy doing so","It's really interesting and the instructors are great!"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Take this class, you won't regret it!","This was a fantastic course that taught me how to critically read papers, and was also incredibly interesting and engaging. I highly recommend this course to anyone considering taking a neuro tutorial","Kyle and Maria are great, and always willing to listen and help you out!","Do not miss your opportunity to take this class. Maria and Kyle are wonderful teachers who really care about what they do. Their enthusiasm and advanced knowledge really makes the class interesting and fun.  This is the first class at Harvard where I came out believing that I gained a skill that will be useful for the rest of my professional career. Kyle and Maria have designed a class that manages to be fun and laid back, while still teaching basic neurobiology and scientific analysis skills.  Again- TAKE THIS TUTORIAL! You will not regret it.","It's great! Take it!","This course covers topics of aggression and sexuality in a fun, challenging, and collaborative atmosphere. The discussion-based nature of the class facilitated my learning; I very much enjoyed learning from my peers as they identified argumentative and experimental holes in research articles. The teaching team is very strong; the professors care deeply about students and consistently check for understanding. The creative in-class activities are enjoyable and I highly recommend this course for people looking to discuss science and research in a collaborative learning environment. We cover many issues and by the end of the year, you really feel like family!"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["THIS CLASS IS AWESOME! Seriously, Olga & Kyle are super amazing and the articles that we go over are great. Also, the presentation by Professor Kravitz was great!","Interesting course material. First semester is very drosophila intensive; only second semester do you get to humans. You learn a lot about techniques to approach questions in neurobiology and the papers and instructors are really interesting","Great class! The professors are wonderful and the course material is challenging but definitely doable.","It's all about Drosophila first semester, so brace yourself.","This class is amazing and I'm glad I took it! One of my favorite classes at Harvard!","Kyle and Olga are both really fun, and do a great job of facilitating a comfortable group discussion. The papers you read are really interesting, although fairly complex. If you enjoy dissecting papers related to sex than this is definitely a great class to take!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This class was wonderful and so formative to my college career!","If you're new to scientific papers, this is a great introduction. They really walk you through the steps to understanding.","This course was a lot of fun! Kyle and Olga are extremely nice, and class discussions about the research articles are very enjoyable. Of course, the topic is sex and aggression, so some of the conversations can be hilarious. This is also a great way to practice reading challenging research articles, as you delve very deeply into them. If you are at all interested in the subject matter, I highly recommend that you take this course.","This class is AMAZING. A must-take for neurobiology concentrators, especially if you're more interested in behavioral stuff than in-depth molecular stuff.","One of the few classes at Harvard where enough attention is given to individual readings. Instead of assigning hundreds of pages of reading and not discussing any of it, this class assigns a few papers a week and digs deep into them, really teaching you how to analyze scientific research and understand the field. More classes should be structured like this.","Kyle and Olga are really great and made the experience in the class. Put a lot of work into your presentation as it's the main showcase in the class, but as long as you're interested in the topic it'll be fine!","This is a fabulous tutorial!! Kyle is amazing, and the readings are really interesting. It's a great chance to interact with great teachers. I looked forward to it every week!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"1.60","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"11","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"NEUROBIO 95hfx","course_id":"3916","cat_num":"59285","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"NEUROBIO 95hfx","course_id":"3916","cat_num":"59285","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"NEUROBIO 95hfx","course_id":"3916","cat_num":"59285","1s":"5","2s":"6","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
