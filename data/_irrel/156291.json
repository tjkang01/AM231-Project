The material is presented well, and the workload is very agreeable. Assignments feel like accomplishments instead of busywork. The instructor is very cordial and takes and interest in students' progress and changes the teaching style to match the feedback from the class.","If you're anything like me, you probably despise 2 hour long classes that meet in the evening once a week 'cause let's be honest, they are usually super boring and awful.\nThis class, however, is nothing like that. You will wish it was three hours long and met twice a week. Racha is a great prof. Always funny and entertaining and extremely knowledgeable about Middle High German language and literature. Excellent course all around.","Fantastic introduction to Middle High German"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"5.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GERMPHIL 200","course_id":"12401","cat_num":"16474","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"GERMPHIL 200","course_id":"12401","cat_num":"16474","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
