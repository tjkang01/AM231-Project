'12":{"comments":["You get a lot of one-on-one attention and your Arabic and confidence speaking will improve quickly.","Sudanese is a really cool dialect of Arabic, and it's really nice to be able to learn and practice speaking and day-to-day communication.  Mohamed is awesome and really cares about his students.  Because the class is small, it's really easy to tailor it to what we are interested in learning about or what we are having trouble understanding.  Mohamed also focuses on making sure we gain a knowledge of Sudanese culture and takes us to Sudanese community events, which is a neat experience."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This class will introduce you to a lot of Sudanese vocabulary, and Mohamed is really nice and a wealth of information about all things Sudanese.  However, it's definitely not as intense as the standard Arabic track at Harvard (for better or for worse, depending on your perspective), and it's helpful to be more of a self-motivated person, because that's how you'll learn the vocabulary and the grammar - we practice in class but there's not much structured homework to reinforce it.","Great class, great intro to not only the language but the culture as well.","absolutely amazing class. you improve greatly and it is very enjoyable. professor khalifa is great. no negatives at all"]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["I would recommend this class ONLY if you have a background in Arabic. The teacher is good at teaching those who already know Arabic, but from scratch its very difficult to grasp much of anything the way the course is structured. It is a very low stress environment though since the TF is so nice. The class is always VERY small."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["Strong recommend if you're at all interested in Sudanese culture or visiting Sudan one day.","Ustaaz is incredibly supportive and really cares about his students - very fortunate to have had him as an instructor this semester! He was very invested in teaching us as much as he could, and one of the friendliest teachers I've had at Harvard."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["I cannot recommend this course highlight enough. Ustaaz is incredibly passionate and dedicated, and you will learn so much about the language and culture of Sudan!","A great 5th class! Ustaz Khalifa is one of the kindest professors you will ever meet.","Great professor and really interesting and worth while material."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"2.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AFRAMER 90R.U","course_id":"23","cat_num":"127929","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AFRAMER 90r.u","course_id":"23","cat_num":"46375","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AFRAMER 90R.U","course_id":"23","cat_num":"127929","1s":"2","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
