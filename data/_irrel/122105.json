It can be wonderful, but it requires student initiative.","You will meet many interesting people in the business world and academic world, and learn from their experience.","Cool mix of academic and professional perspectives on economics and technology.","The seminars are very interesting and you will learn a lot about a breadth of topics. The only assignment is a research paper for the class, which is both a benefit to the course but also a downside. There is little direction or assistance given for the paper (I was only given a deadline and minimum page count). It is an enjoyable, low effort class, but be ready to put in effort for the final paper."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Definitely go to lectures, they are so interesting and provide a great overview of the economics of science and technology today.
