Irit really cares about all her students and has perfected the course over the years (the excellent course materials are all her own). Be prepared though to study grammar and lots of vocab. its worth it though to gain the vocabulary and basic fluency. Very rewarding course with a caring professor.","This class is great if you want to learn Hebrew and understand how to have basic conversations. But if you are just looking to fulfill the language requirement, it is a pretty tough language.","This was one of the best classes that you will take. Irit works very hard with her students and our section leader, Mihaly, was very accessible and always willing to help. An amazing introduction to Hebrew. Would definitely recommend!","This is a fantastic class!!! I loved learning the language.","You will learn hebrew but it will be a painful experience."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Taking Hebrew was hands-down the best decision I made this semester. Irit is an excellent teacher and you learn so much from her, but beyond that you look forward to class every day because it's so fun and because Irit clearly cares so much about her students. I'd recommend this to anyone with any vague interest in Hebrew -- it is so worth it.","The class moves quickly but you will learn a lot in the year.","I would so highly recommend this class. The teaching staff is amazing and they do everything they can to help their students."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"6.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"9","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MOD-HEB BB","course_id":"13437","cat_num":"159988","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"MOD-HEB BB","course_id":"13437","cat_num":"159988","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
