'08":{"comments":["definitely would recommend to swahili b students to continue to pursue!","Taking Swahili has changed my life. Seriously."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["Learning another language works your brain in a totally different way and provides undergraduates with a tangible school as they leave behind their liberal arts education for a working world. I have learned so much about another culture and myself and really enjoyed this class. Learning an African Language is particularly cool because it is interesting, not too difficult, and opens up doors in the world of international development, policy, health, and education.","Swahili is a beautiful language, and this class will push you to understand it more thoroughly. The teaching is excellent."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["Judith Mmari is an amazing teacher. This is an incredible small personal wonderful class. Take it.","The African Language department at Harvard is a little-known about part of the University, but one with amazing, caring teachers who are committed to giving all students a wonderful background in their language. More than anything, having taken Swahili classes all four years here, this has been an important, and shaping part of my college experience, and the instructors are warm and caring, making me continue to want to learn from them.","This is a good class in which to improve your Swahili skills, make sure you're a good listener and speaker though, because there are no brief English interludes like in lower Swahili classes."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Learning Swahili is a great way to better understand East African culture, and this class will certainly help with that.","This was a fantastic class in that at this level, we were given the opportunity to choose what we wanted to work on. The class was small and individualized, and I was able to learn about more coloquial Swahili, advanced vocab, and learning how to talk less like a text-book and more like an East African.","Great course for enhancing your already-established Swahili skills. Judy is a phenomenal instructor (patient, enthusiastic, and dedicated) and I noticed a sizable improvement in my reading, writing, and speaking skills after taking this course."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["How much you learn is really in your control.  It's possible to just do a minimal amount of work without serious repercussions, but you don't learn much of anything if you do that.  The real learning comes from how much time and effort you dedicate to the class.  You have to take the incentive.","If you're thinking about taking this class to continue learning Swahili - poa! It's pretty chill and flexible, since it's small and Judith (who's a very dedicated teacher and makes awesome chai) will shape the course to be how you want it, provided you tell her. That being said, the class is what you make of it, so if you actually want to learn something, take initiative.","You must be prepared to review Swahili outside of class very consistently because we are only able to meet as a group twice a week.","You'll have fun with your Swahili friends in this course. Do be prepared as Judith is a much more intense instructor than those you are likely to have had in the past. That being said, this will be a fairly rewarding experience. You will be surprised how much Swahili you will learn in a semester. Don't be afraid","The class can be challenging, especially if you have no background in conversational swahili or are uncomfortable languages. However, overall it is very good at helping to get a better grasp at swahili beyond simple sentence structures and children's songs."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Be very comfortable with Swahili before you take this class","Judith is AMAZING. This class is really enjoyable and a great context to continue to practice language skills orally and","If you are interested in continuing your Swahili language training through literature and culture, this is a wonderful class! Mwalimu Judith is so kind and knowledgeable, and can tailor the readings\/coursework to cover topics your class finds interesting. It's generally a small class so you get lots of conversational practice!"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Swahili 101ar with Judith is amazing, as always. Judith is a great instructor and really pushes you to challenge yourself in reading the Swahili literature. It is a low time commitment, but gives you the chance to really learn how to read Swahili in a small setting."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Judith is such a brilliant instructor.
