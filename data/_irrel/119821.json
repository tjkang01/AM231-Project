'09":{"comments":["That they should be self-motivated","If like me you are great at informal swahili and weak at formal, academic swahili this is a great way to improve it.","Great way to learn Swahili as it is spoken outside of academic settings.","y"]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["Swahili 1010br will make your Swahili better, but be prepared to spend a lot of time on the chapter readings, you can't get away with just a few hours of work a week.","Taking an African Language at Harvard is one of the most personable, culturally exciting experiences."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Light workload and most of it has to do with how creative\/analytical you can get. Totally recommend it!","Take this class! At this level and in such a small class environment, it is a great opportunity to really get into depth with your Swahili skills and reach toward fluency. 2 years of a language is not really enough to make it useful, but an extra year really helps. The teacher is amazing, the class tailored very much to your needs, and overall it has been one of my favorite classes."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["I learned so much, in such a relaxed, comfortable setting.  The best part was that it was a small class, so we were able to have really in-depth discussions in a way that gave us the time to really think about our opinions on whatever subject we were discussing.  It was also really great to have these discussions in Swahili: I'm fluent, and even I felt like it was a great chance to polish up and learn how to articulate myself 'professionally'"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Make sure to prepare a lot on your own. You can learn a lot, but you must be willing to put in the extra time outside of class.","If you enjoy Swahili and don't mind doing a lot more work than other Swahili classes require, this is a fun, rewarding experience.  Be prepared to speak a lot in class even when you don't know any of the words you trying to use, and be prepared to spend a lot of time on reading and translating and studying vocabulary.","Swahili is a beautiful language, Judith is an amazing TF, and overall I couldn't be happy with this class. I took it nearly every semester since freshman and it was my favorite class almost every time. Thank you for giving me a new language. Judith cares so much and makes you laugh and look at the world in a different way. Truly a transformative experience.","Chances are if you're reading this, you already like Swahili - yay! Relatively light way to keep practicing and learning more.","Only take this if you really want to spend your time reading in Swahili and discussing it. This class took much more effort than any other previous Swahili classes, and although it was rewarding to read in this manner, it was more than I expected. The material was difficult, but I felt the grading was easy."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This course is easy IF you practice in class and do the readings. You must put effort into your Swahili if you want to get something out of the course. Mwalimu Judith is a wonderful teacher and an all-around great person! Enjoy the course!","It is a great class, it facilitates very interesting discussions, it challenges you and opens your eyes to see things from very different perspectives.","Kama unataka kufanyia mazoezi kiswahili chako basi usisite kuchukua hili darasa.","If you are interested in improving your Swahili in a non-stress environment, take the class. Check in with Mugane\/Judith to see what level might be best for you, but all in all it's a great opportunity.","A wonderful class, and yet an unparalleled way to master Spoken Swahili.","If you are taking Swahili, definitely stick with it up until this class! Getting to read real novels and newspaper articles (and watch\/appreciate Swahili television) is super interesting and rewarding.","If you know Swahili well enough to use it in everyday life and well enough to write a 6-page essay, I don't even know why you are looking at Q scores. Take it!!! If you are challenged in Swahili, do hesitate. Take an intense Swahili reading and writing course before this one.","It's pure bliss. You will come out more challenged about your original thinking than ever before."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["Class was great throughout the semester. The final and midterm were the hardest part (as they probably should be). However, also felt that they could really blindside you. Prepare ahead of time if she keeps the same format for the Wananchi class. Also, the Wananchi class is very much student directed. Unfortunately, that means often time I left not really knowing much about how to read difficult text (or even newspapers in Swahili) without heavy use of dictionary.","Swahili with Judith is always a pleasure! Taking 101 has vastly improved my reading and writing skills in Swahili. Towards the end, we started watching a Tanzanian tv series, which aided in my hearing skills as well.","Great advanced Swahili class that will challenge your current understanding and usage of the language. Be prepared to speak a lot in class but make sure you are taking this class with people whose interests align to yours because each person picks a topic of discussion for their week."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"2.50","workload":null,"difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SWAHILI 101BR","course_id":"99","cat_num":"119821","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SWAHILI 101br","course_id":"99","cat_num":"7746","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SWAHILI 101br","course_id":"99","cat_num":"7746","1s":"5","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
