Do not expect to get a good grade, but do expect to learn a lot of spanish.","This class is the best way to jump start Spanish language learning in a semester.","While this class was rather difficult ... and intensive, as its name suggests, I learned an incredible amount of Spanish in four months.  I strongly recommend for any students interested in learning the language as quickly and thoroughly as possible to take this course.","DO IT!","This is an excellent class provided you have learned a language linguistically before, particularly a romance language. It also takes a lot of time and regular work."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["I would say that they should definitely consider taking it, but that it's pretty difficult.","This class is a great way to learn a lot of Spanish in a very short amount of time. It is a fun class and is definitely very enjoyable.","This course is a pretty serious time commitment, but it was well worth it.","the course is amazing, but definitely be prepared to put in a lot of time and effort.","I've taken many language courses at some of the best institutions there are, and this is definitely the best I've ever taken! I strongly recommend it to anyone that wants to learn Spanish and learn it fast. This is one course I enjoyed waking up early because it was so much fun.","The intensive program is great to get a general understanding of a language quickly, however, I worry that because of the rapidity of the course and the lack of time to let things \"seep in\" that I will lose this language quickly once leaving the course.  If possible, I would recommend Spanish A (non-intensive).  Also, though having taken another language makes taking a class at this level possible, it is also a stumbling block for some since you have to think yourself out of the other foreign language that you know better.","It is difficult to learn a language in such a short amount of time and takes continual practice otherwise many things that you learn will be forgotten, especially since the pace is so fast.","It is difficult and fast-paced but extremely fun and worth the time. You pick up the language fast.","I would tell them that it's an intensive course for a reason. The class is very fast paced. But if you are interested in learning Spanish, then this is the best one to take as it will help them learn quickly in a short amount of time.","Mariana is fantastic.","This is one of the best classes you can take in terms of learning a language. I can't imagine a faster, more efficient, or better way to learn a language.","It's the best language I have taken over my whole experience as a student.","This is a great course, and you will learn a lot, and if you want to learn Spanish quickly there is no better way. However, be prepared for it; it's not easy and it moves quickly. Stay on top of the work, and do your exercises every night, so the night before the quiz is not a disaster.","A wonderful way to get a strong grasp of the basic grammatical structures and vocabulary needed to communicate in Spanish in a short space of time. Ideal for anyone looking to see huge improvements quickly.","This course is among the best classes at Harvard. Going to class each day is a lot of fun. The small class size allowed me to get to know my classmates well which made for a great intimate language-learning experience. The quality of the teaching is outstanding. I have rarely seen such dedication to one's students by a teacher in my time as a student. Who knew learning a language could be so much fun? Now I want to learn more about the Spanish-speaking world!","This course is demanding, and it moves quickly. In the beginning it may seem overwhelming, but you pick up the rhythm of quick language-learning, and then you can be strategic about and how much you practice and study outside of class. There's a certain satisfaction in not languishing with partial language-knowledge throughout two semesters and instead seeing your language improve from week to week in a one-semester intense course. Now, at the end of the semester, it's hard to imagine that in January of this year I hardly knew a word of Spanish.","This class is an incredible introduction to Spanish, encompassing everything from grammar to cultural education, and any student will be astonished at how much they learn in a mere four months.","This class may sound intimidating on paper, but the workload is not as much as expected, and it's a really great opportunity to learn Spanish quickly, get to know some very interesting people since classes are so small, and work with incredible professors.  I wholeheartedly recommend this course to anybody considering studying Spanish.  I have really enjoyed taking this class and am severely disappointed that there is no intensive intermediate Spanish.  I can't explain enough how much I have enjoyed this class.","Easily one of the best classes I took at Harvard.","If you are willing to put in the work and study a lot for the quizzes you can do well, and Sylvia is always there to help, she really wants to to be successful."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["This class is so amazing. It's incredible how quickly you'll learn Spanish. Really be prepared to put in the full effort to the class. Chances are you're taking this as an elective so the more you put into it the more you will get out. You will learn so much Spanish it's nuts. So worth it!","It is one of the most fruitful and fun class I have taken so far; you can start speaking Spanish in 3 months ad have a lot of fun on your way there.","Take this over Spanish Aa. Acd will be a thousand times more worthwhile because you'll learn a thousand times more without even realizing it. Getting access to this much face time with a professor is INVALUABLE.","If you want to learn Spanish take Acd! It's basically complete immersion into a new language and ensures that you will leave with an incredible amount of knowledge and able to speak and write Spanish well."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Take this class! It's THE best way to learn beginner Spanish!","This is such a fun class! It is not that difficult, but you still learn so much!","This was honestly the best and most fun class I've taken at Harvard.  Even after 6 weeks or so, you already have a deeper understanding of the language and can have basic conversations.  It's a great feeling!  Plus, while the assignments may take some time, they aren't difficult.  Mariana is fantastic!","imperative to do homework and reading on time.","It was fun! Be ready for daily class at nine, and don't sign up if you can't commit, but if you do then you'll enjoy it","If you want to learn Spanish, TAKE THIS CLASS! You should do more work than the class asks of you (and the class already asks a lot of you), but incredibly you will be able to become proficient in Spanish in the span of four months. The instructor, Mariana San Mart\u00c3\u00adn is outstanding, fun, and available, and she really makes taking the class a pleasure.","This is a great class. Be sure about you're reasons for taking it though... it's a lot of work and requires a great deal of commitment on a daily basis. Mariana is an amazing instructor and you'll have a lot of fun studying it. DO NOT fall behind in the class, it's all downhill from there.","This class is amazing!!! It's just one term but you learn so much. It's kind of mind-boggling: after three months, I can speak\/read\/understand a good amount of Spanish. I would definitely take this class over Aa\/Ab; Acd feels like 1.5 classes at most but it counts for 2, you get to progress more quickly, and you get to have more motivated peers - since Acd can't fulfill the language requirement. And you get to have Mariana!","This course is extremely demanding, but the payoffs are enormous.","This intensive language class exceeds all my expectations.  However, it requires active involvement and dedication from the student.  There is little room for slacking, especially for students without previous background in romance languages.","This course moves very quickly and one should know beforehand the time and amount of work necessary to succeed.","Take this class if you are serious about learning Spanish! It is not easy but it will impart you a good foundation of Spanish.","This is one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard - you learn so much so quickly, and Mariana is a PHENOMENAL instructor.  Take it!  Recommended very very highly.","The more work you put into this course the more you get out of it! Definitely practice every day and try to speak Spanish with as many people as possible."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This course is very intensive but not too much and provides an excellent grounding in Spanish.","This is a really great class if you're serious about learning Spanish. I would recommend really keeping up with the grammar because it can get difficult towards the end. And definitely practice SPEAKING with other students.","A phenomenal way to learn Spanish really quickly.  Mariana is an incredible teacher.  Think seriously about the 7 hr\/week time commitment before you enroll.  I took this with three other courses and a fair extracurricular load and found it to be a little too much.  The more time you put into this course, the better you'll get at Spanish!  Take advantage of this class before you graduate, and put in the time!","Very enjoyable and useful! Just know how many class hours there are and make sure you have time for it.  How much time you spend a week is not a given, as it really depends on your ability\/competence with language.","This course was one of the most rewarding I have taken at school. If you really want to learn Spanish, this is the best way to learn it (if you don't have time to fully immerse yourself in a spanish-speaking country, that is). The workload is difficult (there are times when you will have a presentation, ~3-hour CENTRO assignment, and 2-chapter quiz all in one week), but the assignments are very useful and satisfying. Mariana is all that you could want in an instructor-- she is kind, warm, supportive, thoughtful, understanding, and incredibly intelligent, organized, clear, and prepared. SHE is the reason this course is such a success. Her expectations are high, but that is because she believes in your ability to learn. She is extremely patient and encouraging and dispels any notions in a student that he\/she is a terrible language learner. I left the course with a confidence that with time, I could become very skilled at Spanish and I owe that largely to Mariana's nurturing teaching style.","In a course that meets every day, it's imperative that you click with the instructor. That being said, I though Mariana was wonderful and I would have a hard time imagining someone who would not get along with her.","The course is a lot of fun!  Be prepared to spend some time memorizing vocabulary, but other than that, I can't see how the course could possibly be much harder than Aa or Ab.  It is really satisfying at the end of the course when you are able to have conversations easily in Spanish, and write essays with somewhat sophisticated language.  Mariana is also great!","Take this course! This is a great way to learn Spanish. The course is engaging, interesting, and at times, rather entertaining. Plus, you get to hear some great Spanish music, which is definitely a plus. Definitely of the best courses I've taken here at Harvard, but be prepared to do the work required to make the most of it.","Don't fall behind - it's easy to push work in this class to the bottom of the barrel, but as soon as you fall even slightly behind you will be in deep trouble.","This is an EXCELLENT class to learn an incredible amount of spanish in a very short time.  Do not underestimate this class as an intro language class, it is a challenging course in terms of the amount of material you will learn but that also makes it very rewarding.  Mariana is an amazing teacher and really does a great job of covering the material and making it interesting and engaging.","You need to study EVERYDAY. Seriously, and speak in class as much as physically possible.","This class is awesome!  Definitely take it if you want to learn Spanish - you'll be amazed at how much you learn over the course of the semester!","Be ready to put in a substantial amount of time, especially if this is your first Romance language."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This is a great class! I don't think I could've learned Spanish any faster unless I had moved to a Spanish speaking country for the last 3 months.","Very intensive!","This class was a great way to get all of the structures and basic vocab of Spanish down. Having a 9am class for 7 hours every week was a little annoying, but totally worth it. Mariana was a great instructor. The course counts as 2, and it's not quite as much work as taking 2 classes would be but it is more work than just one, so keep that in mind when picking other classes for the semester. Things pick up quickly in this class!","When studying, practice reading Spanish aloud.  This not only helps your pronunciation and fluency, but it also helps you internalize the language and its grammar.","I loved this class and I think it's the perfect senior year elective if you want to learn Spanish. You're in a class with other students who are also there because they want to learn Spanish, and you'll have a wonderful instructor if Mariana is still teaching the course. Make sure to keep up with the material though so that it doesn't pile up.","Take this class! It is amazing! Mariana is the best person ever. She is so patient and kind and really is there to help you out if you need it.  The class was wonderful and I learned Spanish!!  It's a lot of work, but it's worth it.","If you want to learn Spanish, I can't imagine doing it any other way. I'd say it's equivalent to about 1.5 classes. You learn more than twice as much as Spanish Aa, yet its still fun due to the great teaching and high quality of the students in the class.","One of the best language classes I have taken at Harvard. Mariana is an incredible teacher - patient, understanding, dynamic. This course requires a lot of work and effort so only take it if you are prepared to do the work.","it's a very good way to reach a basic level in a very short time. Definitely worth it."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This class is fantastic. I learned so much and Mariana is the best teacher you could have.","This is an absolutely amazing class. You walk in with absolutely NO prior knowledge of Spanish AT ALL. You walk out with a wide range of vocabulary and grammar rules, stellar reading comprehension and writing abilities (these skills were the most developed in my opinion) and pretty good oral communication and comprehension abilities (you will definitely get at least the general gist of most spoken Spanish and will for sure be able to communicate your thoughts, maybe not perfectly, but enough to get the idea across). Mariana is an absolute angel. An amazing teacher and a lovely person. Love her, love her, love her. Take the class just so you can have a learning experience with her.","If you want to learn the basics of Spanish in one semester, I will recommend this class with enthusiasm. Mariana is simply amazing, and the course materials are really interesting as well. Spanish Acd definitely takes up the hours and workload of two courses, so keep that in mind before you choose to take it.","Mariana is hands down one of the best instructors I've had here at Harvard. She is fun, extremely kind and deeply cares about her students. We cover a lot in this class, but you will be armed with a strong foundation in Spanish.","This course is fantastic. Take it if you want to learn Spanish--you'll be astonished at how fast you pick it up!","Fantastic course. I learned so much in just a few months. We went through a lot of content very quickly, but because the class was well taught and we had a lot of time to practice as a group, it never felt unmanageable.","This is a phenomenal course with an even better instructor! It's amazing how quickly you'll move through the language. It does require a certain level of commitment however if only because of the number of hours of class and homework. Be careful\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit often conflicted with my other classes because Spanish felt more urgent. Nonetheless, I recommend this class with enthusiasm!","Absolutely take it! Fun class environment, great TF, learned a lot","This is the best language course I've ever taken; Mariana is an extremely enthusiastic and talented teacher.

Just know that when they say this class is intensive, they mean it. Do not take a heavy course load or commit yourself to a lot of extracurriculars while you're doing it. The work is not intellectually challenging, just time consuming. If you don't stay on top of your work your grade will suffer.","The class is demanding, but definitely worth the effort. Mariana was a superb teacher in every respect and handled the students' different needs and abilities really well. Whatever you do, you MUST keep up with the work - if you fall behind, it would be really hard to catch up. But the class is fantastic, and if you're serious about wanting to learn Spanish, this is the way to do it.","This class is extremely rewarding; Mariana San Martin is an incredible instructor and extremely helpful. If you are good at languages, take this course without a doubt. You will not find it excessively challenging."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["It is a great class! I enjoyed taking it and it quickly become my favorite class. Glenda is amazing! She is very sweet and taught us, not only the language, but also all about the culture of the Spanish speaking countries. She made the class very fun and yet, we learned so much at the same time!","I personally came to enjoy having class every day. It really gave form to my schedule and the small class size makes it easy to form a community of peers. I grew very close to my classmates and Glenda and this made the classes very enjoyable. As for content, I have never learned a skill so quickly. In addition we learned a lot about the culture and politics of numerous Latin American countries. All in all an amazing investment.","Glenda is the best ever. Coming to this class made me so happy every day--it was so much fun, not to mention a great class. I learned so much, and although I took French for 7 years, I speak better in Spanish. I walk away from this class loving Spanish and being comfortable in it. She makes the process very painless and so very much enjoyable, but you learn so much!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Glenda is a great teacher. She has a lot of enthusiasm for the Spanish language and tries to bring in a lot of cultural activities (i.e. songs, essays, stories, food, etc.) that I found to be really fun and relevant. This class is a really great way to learn Spanish and I would highly recommend it! However, we did stray from the syllabus towards the middle of the class and that can be frustrating if you like to follow a concrete schedule and like to know what to expect in each class.","Before the semester began, I spoke no Spanish, but now I feel incredibly confident in understanding and reading Spanish. It has been a really fun class, and I've learned so much!","This is a really great class. You learn a lot and you learn quickly but Glenda supports your learning and is very responsive in terms of identifying and devoting extra time to concepts that are difficult for the class. The class is really fun with a lot of material outside the textbook including music and film. Glenda is a great and very kind teacher and you will enjoy this class! Stay on top of your work and review a little everyday and you will get great results.","Great class and Glenda is awesome - can be a little disorganized at times but definitely provides you with a solid background in Spanish.","In terms of workload, homework assignments, stuff you have to turn in etc., the class isn't *incredibly* intensive (i.e. you can take 5 classes (=4 classes total) and still be fine). That being said, if you want to make the most of it and learn as much Spanish as possible, you'll really have to put in a lot of work on your own, without anyone telling you to do so, or the \"pressure\" of a grade. You'll go over a LOT of vocabulary, a LOT of conjugation (as in, all the tenses, which can get a little confusing), and that kind stuff only sticks well if you're willing to spend the time to memorize and review it, over and over and again. So I'd say the class works best if you have good work ethics.\r\nOverall I had a great experience (but also keep in mind that yours may vary depending on your instructor \/classmates)."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["If you are thinking of traveling abroad, this is like a crash course boot camp that will whip you in shape to be able to communicate.","Be prepared for an experience. You will become a family and learn so much. It can be a lot of work but also a lot of fun and a great way to learn a language.","This is a great class for those really interested in learning a lot of Spanish in a short period of time. You come out being able to understand and speak an impressive amount for just one semester. I'm not sure if Glenda will still be teaching, but she was absolutely wonderful. She was always enthusiastic and really cares about everyone. She even cooked for us a few times!  The amount of class time may seem like a lot, but it doesn't feel very long when you're actually there. They use a lot of songs and videos to supplement the material, so class is always interesting","This course is conceived and reserved to a specific minority of students, which makes it hard to recommend to anyone. It is however great for learning the basis of the Spanish language, though another Spanish course is required in order to master it."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["This class is great! I felt like I learned a ton this semester. However, be warned - it is very fast paced, especially with the last few tenses we covered, and can be difficult to keep up esp with finals. Definitely study class material before class every day to really be able to apply it. Also can be a little confusing as to what exactly we're covering day to day b\/c a lot of it is chalk talk esque.","There are better programs in which one can learn Spanish (I would recommend travel or the Middlebury Language Schools); I don't think the Harvard Spanish department cares particularly about developing strong language pedagogy or teachers.","This course is fun because it is an insanely productive use of your time. My friends who spent 10 years of lower, middle, and high school learning spanish and then stopped learned roughly the same material that I learned in three months. Not to mention, Glenda is fantastic. She will make the process of learning more enjoyable and fun, and she will go above and beyond if you need her to support you, help you, explain something to you, or just give you a hug.","TAKE THIS CLASS (or take any class that Glenda teaches)! Firstly, Glenda is a wonderful instructor. She truly cares for students and personally concerns for students' future career and life outside of the class. Secondly, the class is a tight community and you will know other students and the instructor very well. Thirdly, another strength about this class is that students come from diverse background - law school, Ed school, freshman to seniors. You will closely work with people who may have totally different academic background or who are much older than you. Therefore you learn to get along well with and cooperate with different people.","This is an incredibly fun course. You'll learn a lot of Spanish in a short amount of time. I would say, too, that for an intensive course (if you keep up with the work), it's not incredibly difficult.","I really enjoyed this class but would really only recommend it to students who A) already speak a romance language and are comfortable with language-learning and B) have the time and motivation to spend several hours a week reviewing and learning the language on their own. Class time is mostly used for practicing the spoken language and using the grammar learned outside of class. Because of the way the class was organized, we ended up covering a lot of material at the very end of the class, learning several new tenses during reading week, which was relatively stressful while trying to finish papers\/prepare for exams for other courses. The class counts as two half-credits and it's definitely manageable with three other half courses, but I would have reservations about taking it with 4 other half courses (as a 'fifth class', but really as a fifth and sixth class). Overall the class was a great experience for me and Glenda was incredible but pedagogically there are a lot of improvements that could be made.","If you want to speak Spanish after one semester go and take this course. Glenda, the teacher, is simply amazing. You are going to enjoy every single lesson with her and also, because you meet every day in a small group with other students, you are quickly going to make good friends with others.\r\nYes, Acd requires work but it's a pleasant work - it's all associated with Spanish music and culture. Yes, it's a 9 am class but to be honest, after a couple of weeks even after busy Sunday night you are gonna find yourself being like \"Meh, it's just Spanish. Let's bounce.\" right after you wake up at 8.50. And the best thing is you'll be able to get a breakfast in Annenberg and be on time. So you get Spanish conversational skills in semester and good start of a day for semester. Take it!"]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This is a great class. If you stick to doing your Spanish practice every day, you learn so much Spanish that you can hold some conversations at the end. The teaching assistant, Maria, also makes it really fun, because she tells us about the cultures of Spanish-speaking countries, plays us songs, introduces us to Hispanic artists, and so on.","This course is well worth the time commitment if you are serious about becoming fluent in Spanish. 9am classes are annoying though","The class is fast-paced, but it's structured so that it's not hard to keep up and to learn all the material. It's such a satisfying experience to gain a passable command of the language in only one semester. 5 days a week at 9am is a lot, but it's worth it."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["If you have already learned another Romance language and you want to get familiarity with Spanish quickly, then this is a great class! You will be with other people who genuinely want to learn the language. It is fast-moving, though, so you may not be able to spend as much time internalizing vocabulary as you might like.","This class requires a decent amount of engagement outside of class, but it is most important to be present and engaged every day in class. If you do this, the outside-of-class work is very manageable. If you want to learn Spanish quickly and provide yourself with a platform to learn more, this is definitely a great choice.","This course is fantastic! I think because it is an intensive course and, at least as was the case the semester I took it, it doesn't count towards the language requirement, the class is going to be relatively small and full of students who are there only because they want to learn Spanish. Maria is fantastic, the class is really engaging, and you will be surprised by how quickly you are able to learn an incredible amount of Spanish AND to begin using it outside of class. All the different types of homework assignments, the layout of the tests, the insight into different cultural aspects of various Spanish-speaking countries, the games, the inclusion of painters and artists from lots of different countries, the movies, and the extensive use of spoken Spanish in class, among other things, will give you lots of exposure and a level of immersion that will really boost your ability to absorb the lanuage. That said, the class requires a non-trivial amount of time for the assignments, and don't underestimate how long it will take you to complete the online activities if you let them pile up as opposed to completing them day by day. Also, if you struggle to get up in the morning as I did, 9am can be rough, but it's definitely worth it. Highly highly highly recommend!!","This class is very well taught. Maria is both passionate and effective in her teaching techniques. It is a big time commitment though. Between 7 hours of class and reinforcing concepts (grammar and memorizing vocabulary words) on your own, however, the class does take a lot of time. Consistently committing 30 min - 1 hr a night  is more than enough, but without doing that you'll be up all night completing assignments and studying for quizzes. I would highly recommend this class for anyone who wants to learn a language in a semester and does not mind 9am\/putting in the time. The small class size and Maria, make even 9am bearable.","If you haven't had any past experience with Spanish and actually want to learn something, take this class. Spanish 10 is for people just trying to get out of the language requirement, but you don't get anything out of it. The workload outside of class is reasonable and it doesn't feel like a full two classes worth of time.","It moves fast, and even if you don't feel like you pick up everything that you're taught (because of time constraints), you definitely learn more than you would in the regular Spanish class.","This course was phenomenal. Maria is extremely dedicated and one of the most creative and engaging teachers I have ever had. The course involved SO much material in only one semester but it was so much fun and so engaging. First off, classes themselves involved a rich variety of Spanish-language materials like songs, videos, cultural explorations, and very fun in-class games to help student engage with one another to review the grammar and vocabulary. Apart from that, Maria has a lot of energy and a great sense of humor. This class felt so complete in so many ways, it really imbued the language with its history and culture to which made it alive and relevant.","You will learn so much Spanish! It's amazing after only one semester of Spanish how much you're able to learn. Maria is amazing, although she won't be teaching this class in the future. Make sure that you really want to spend a lot of time on this, because the class is a big time investment."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"6.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"11","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SPANSH ACD","course_id":"4475","cat_num":"116469","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SPANSH Acd","course_id":"4475","cat_num":"5577","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SPANSH ACD","course_id":"4475","cat_num":"116469","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
