such a close-reading of Anscombe. Because the class mostly focuses on just one book, it's a very thorough introduction.","The quality of a TF is crucial and although Carlos is a nice guy I don't think his teaching is sufficiently strong for a seminar. This will matter a lot, no matter how much you love the topic or the content.","It is a fun philosophy course; the Sellars reading is a bit difficult going, not the most readable style, and can be rather obscure. More might be gained from another course that is not so focused on reading a single historical text."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["Just be aware that the discussion will wind, touching on just about every topic from every direction.

You should ask for something asking for as much writing, if not more, as a class like Phil 8 gets.","Augustine's works and views are very interesting to learn about and it gives a lot of insight into the problem of evil.","This was a painless tutorial and I felt that I learned a lot.","This is just for Professor Kelly","Tutorial provides a great opportunity to practice philosophy and explore an area of interest."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["It is less work than a typical phillosophy class, but it is not half as much work, so it's a little weird that it only counts as half a class.","Anyone with an interest in political philosophy should take this class to better understand classical liberalism. Philosophy concentrators will benefit from the degree of analysis encouraged by the class's discussions. Jiewuh is a very able and sharp section leader, and is excellent at directing discussions while letting students explore concepts themselves.","Brendan's cool -- you'll like the class","Your philosophic views might undergo a radical change.","Sellars is really hard; but I'd take any class that Tom is teaching. He's very good at explaining the concepts and very approachable.","It will be more work than half a class but, if you choose your tutorial wisely, it will be worth it because of the discussions. I put more effort into this course than I had to because I wanted it to be good. Mill is a seminal thinker!"]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["Adrian is a good teacher, but I did not like the material in this class.  Also I did not like the fact that I was forced to take this class against my will.","The topic of narrow content may seem boring or irrelevant to many philosophy students who haven't had much experience with similar topics, but the class is interesting, and Adrian is great at explaining complex arguments.","Professor Kamm is amazing. She's probably one of the greatest moral philosophers alive, and you have her in the same room with you and your fellow philosophy concentrators. Be prepared to work hard, as she does have very high standards, but you learn so much from this class! It feels like a grad class, given the materials we cover and the depth we go into.","This is a difficult, but rewarding class. It is important not to dismiss what there is interesting in the book simply because the text has flaws and is rather convoluted."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["Make sure you're very interested in the course text, because the entire semester is spent delving into it closely. Be prepared to participate - in a class this small, each student is liable to do a lot of talking. Because of this, and because of the generally laid back atmosphere, It ends up feeling more like a book group than an actual class, which is cool.","The subject is interesting but can be very difficult to ground in reality so it can be difficult to understand exactly how to engage with the material.","This course is as interesting as it sounds; if you're into the problem of evil from an early modern perspective (which itself is related to myriad other issues in philosophy), the class provides a laid-back yet vigorous introduction to the major voices of the time.","Be charitable to Hume, and consider when he was writing. Have an open mind.","A good, interesting class with a really great TF. My only complaint was that this was too heavy on the work front for a half course.","We ignore the theological aspects of philosophy at our peril, since theological concerns informed much of the thought of western thinkers for much of the last 2000 years.","A great class!","This is a great course.  I had Tom Fehse and would recommend 'with enthusiasm.'  He taught an awesome course on Moore's Paradox, in which we really delved into the topic.  It was one of the first times I felt like I was really doing serious academic philosophy, just attacking a single issue for months.  Discussion was lively and fun.  Great class.","This course is an excellent opportunity to engage in close and careful reading of a fascinating text by an extraordinary author.","This close study of the Critique of Practical Reason affords an extremely in-depth encounter with Kant's ethical theory and the theory of action or practical reason enmeshed in it.  For students of moral and political philosophy, this course is an essential complement to study of the Groundwork and Kant's political writings.","Junior tutorials vary in topic and in who teaches them, so what applies to one won't apply to another. I loved this one, though.","Pay close attention to the Wittgenstein readings, as they contain a number of very important ideas that will come up later in the course.","Tom is a really good teacher and doesn't expect students to do an unrealistic amount of reading as some teachers do.","This class is primarily about natural evil and not moral evil. This is not an ethics class. It's a great class and the material is interesting, but it night be what you expect if you just look at the course title.","I seriously doubt you will have my same tutorial"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["It's interesting and fun!","Fantastic class!","Each semester of the junior tutorial counts only for a quarter of a course credit, so make sure you pick one that won't frustrate you with unfocused discussion. On a positive note, however, got to meet with MIT professor Sally Haslanger and discuss her work; this is not an opportunity one gets in every philosophy class.","What I appreciate most about this course is the Philosophy Department's flexibility which made it possible. The Philosophy Department requires a junior tutorial, and I am very grateful that the department was able to create this Philosophy of Religion course to satisfy the requirement.","Philosophy tutorials change, so it's unlikely this will be offered again, but it was very good. A lot of what makes a tutorial is the TF, so I'd just recommend any tutorial with Austin. The topic (metaphysics of properties) was extremely interesting even though it isn't in my usual area.","You probably won't get to take this class since it was a one time only Junior Tutorial, but whatever the topic of your tutorial, it will probably be amazing too, so don't be too sad. But you did miss out on an awesome course--I think it's safe to say if time travel were possible, then your reasons would require you travel back in time and take this course."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Great course, interesting and engaging.","At first I didn't really know what I would be getting myself into taking a philosophy of film tutorial. It turned out to be one of the most interesting and certainly different courses I've taken at Harvard, and I got to read one of the most difficult but interesting texts ever.","Both the Nietzsche and Choice tutorials were really well-constructed and led very well.  Conversations flowed very well in both as they were given the proper balance of structure and freedom.  Readings were excellent and enlightening, and assignments were actually a lot of fun to do.","This class will give you the best possible way of reading an extremely entertaining and important book.","be prepared to be graded 1\/2-time for this course--you will spend, on average, the same amount of time (or more) as you would on other philosophy courses that are not being graded 1\/2-time. it's frustrating.","Pick your tutorial based at least half on the tutor! We had great luck with ours.","Interesting but not too stressful.  Definitely a good way to learn something new about an area of philosophy and get a chance to really discuss what you think.","This is a great Philosophy Junior Tutorial! If you want to learn something about Nietzsche and be exposed to a different style of philosophic writing from the crystal-clear English philosophers and present-day philosophers, take this tutorial! Alex is an awesome tutorial leader.","The tutorials can be very rewarding but it depends highly on which TF you get assigned to."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["It is an interesting close reading of Scanlon's Moral Dimensions. It was worthwhile reading this book closely, trying to map Scanlon's position. If there are more secondary sources added, this course will be an amazing, comprehensive tutorial. Right now it was very interesting but perhaps materially limited.","Great tutorial if you're interested in self-knowledge.","As far as junior tutorials go, this is a really good one. Do the reading and try to get involved in the topic. Discussions are way more interesting when you're thinking about these concepts and have something to contribute. The \"something\" doesn't have to be a new theory of mind or something impressive; questions are just as good, if not better.","The reading is pretty tough to get through (challenging and slow to read), but the topics are relevant and encourage thought. Jiewuh is a great TF!","An in depth look at a specific area of philosophy will easily show you if you love it or not. If you are already interested in the topic, then the course is sure to be great.","Your experience will depend on the quality of your small group of peers and TF. It'll be different for everybody, but if you enjoy philosophy, then this should be nice for you."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This was an amazing class and definitely one of the best ones I've taken at Harvard.

Having a small discussion every week is enjoyable and engaging.","Everything about this class depends on the instructor. In an ideal world, these tutorials would be taught by professors. But this is Harvard, so you'll get a grad student instead. If you get one who has a passion for teaching, you're in luck. Or, if you're like me and got one who had no ability to foster discussion, shut down ideas that weren't his own (yet also never actually gave us his interpretation), and literally told us that \"there's a certain number of seconds I'm supposed to let you be silent before I change the topic, but I can't remember how many it is,\" you're screwed. You'll be able to tell within the first week if the tutorial will be successful -- if it isn't, drop it or transfer to another one. I wish I had."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Great introduction to big questions in epistemology.","This was a really nice course. I had never taken a class in epistemology before and this was a nice introduction to it.","good stuff and very interesting, though a little abstract and technical","Emily is interesting, kind, helpful, and understanding. She gives her students a lot of freedom to pursue their interests. That did make the class a little unfocused at times. But all in all, a painless and interesting junior tutorial!","Hopefully they do end up changing this course to be one half course like the sophomore tutorial. That would have markedly improved the tutorial."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["Overall a great junior tutorial! Have to be interested in political philosophy to get the most out of it"]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Very good class, although it obviously depends on which section you choose.","Olivia was a fantastic TF, and I really learned a lot both about the field of emotions (which I had previously known nothing about) and about how to improve my own reading. As with all tutorials, make sure you're really interested in the specific topic yours is on - it's too intense a class to dislike or not care about the material and still succeed.","This is a wonderful opportunity to work closely with peers and a graduate student in an intellectually rigorous environment. You get the opportunity to study an area of philosophy in more depth than Phil 97, and have the chance to develop your own views on that area.","Tutorials are a great way to get personalized one-on-one feedback with your writing. Also, in Phil 98, you get to write a longer paper towards the end. So, such a paper could be useful if one is thinking about a potential writing sample for grad school.","If Lauren is still teaching this (or really anything else), you should definitely take it. She is a great communicator, super nice, and very approachable. She is the rare person who is wicked smart and also able to clearly communicate her ideas. She is really good at understanding what her students' misunderstandings or frustrations are and helping them come to a fuller understanding.","This is a great comprehensive introduction to Hume!","This course can vary depending on your seminar leader, but my experience was overwhelmingly positive. You receive much helpful feedback on your writing as you continue to develop critical analyses skills.","David Hume is one of the greats, especially when it comes to moral philosophy.  This course delves deep into Hume, to bring out his insights as well as faults.  If you are interested at all in exploring how we as people interact with one another, sympathize with one another and judge each other, as well as being challenged to do so, this is a fantastic and thought-provoking course.","the junior tutorial is a big step towards being a clearer thinker. i would recommend this course even if you are MBB. the feedback you receive for your writing makes it a very special learning experience.","Definitely dense but interesting"]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Chandler is amazing, and this course went through some of the best texts political philosophy has to offer. Go learn from some of the greats.","Tutorials are great because you usually get to look at a very narrow topic with a small number of people. They are very writing heavy which I think is great becuase you really get to work on your philosophical writing skills.","You will definitely learn a lot from a class of this style. I would recommend that you keep manage your schedule well because the grading it pretty tough."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHIL 98","course_id":"4044","cat_num":"116407","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PHIL 98hf","course_id":"4044","cat_num":"5533","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHIL 98","course_id":"4044","cat_num":"116407","1s":"1","2s":"7","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
