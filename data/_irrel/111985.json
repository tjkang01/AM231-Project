I would encourage them to look upon it positively. But I think I would direct non-concentrators to a more broad class, such as Religion 43."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["If you get a small tutorial like I did, be prepared to do a lot of work and get a lot out of it in return.","The opportunity to have a one-on-one tutorial tailored to your own individual interests is incredible!  I got so much more out of this class than out of any other class I've taken at Harvard.  Classes like this are really the strength of the Religion Department."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["This is an invaluable opportunity, make it yours.","Be prepared to let your intellectual horizons expand.","Excellent readings, great leader, really enjoyed reading, contemplating, and discussing the material.","Can learn a lot studying under Chip's tutelage.","Do your reading, go to class prepared, and you will really benefit from John's teaching. Go into section with questions for clarification and elaboration.","It's a thorough, informative way to delve into the dialogue between religion and science in the West, particularly with regard to evolution."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Michael is awesome!!","Theology of Prisons is a great corse that can be taken to help one realize what effect incarceration has had on classic thinkers and then apply that to whatever modern field they want.","This class is great because the level of personalization for each comparative religious studies concentrator cannot be beat. My course instructor was very engaged, and the subject matter of the course helped me to think about my topic in ways I wouldn't have explored on my own or in any other classes.","TAKE THIS CLASS! It is so interesting and you learn a lot about very interesting concepts! Both religion and med enthusiasts- go for it! It is not too time intensive and Austin is amazing and super helpful."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"8","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 98A","course_id":"5031","cat_num":"111985","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RELIGION 98a","course_id":"5031","cat_num":"2832","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 98A","course_id":"5031","cat_num":"111985","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
