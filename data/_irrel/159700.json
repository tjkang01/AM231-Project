{"scores":[],"comments":{"Fall '15":{"comments":["It's a great chance to get to know a small group of students interested in the same thing, and to read cool papers and ask questions without feeling pressure to sound smart.","Great class Shaun rocks","Take this course to learn about how the brain's mysteries unfold. Very manageable coursework and papers are fascinating. Would recommend with enthusiasm!","A great look into an exciting field of neurobiology that really deals with the most functional side of the spectrum: understanding how the brain works from live and\/or human subjects. The framework of decoding and also encoding a neural code is at the heart of the course, and understanding it can be very beneficial as the field moves in a more computational direction. The class itself is not demanding in its workload, generally requiring a paper summary or a short coding assignment, but the opportunity to engage with the material and a fantastic instructor is not to be missed.","The discussion and questions raised during class about how what the \"neural code\" is and to what extend we can \"decode\" elements of our consciousness are really interesting. The class is very fair and doesn't have much work outside of class."]}},"mostRecentQ":null,"success":true}
