It is the class that made me feel like a graduate student for the depth and breadth of the material you cover, and the sheer enjoyment of learning a new language. It was my favorite class all year.","Come ready work; if your other classes are difficult and\/or time consuming, you may struggle in this class due to its intensive and fast-paced nature; note to undergrads: it attracts predominantly humanities graduate students","I greatly benefited from this course, and Dan was a fabulous teacher.
