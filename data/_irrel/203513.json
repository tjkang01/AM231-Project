The coursework is not hard, but ready to give it your all during class time.","ASL is the most amazing and beautiful language offered at Harvard. It's amazingly fun and engaging, and you learn so much about Deaf culture and history.","This class is a wonderful way to start learning ASL and about Deaf Culture. Let me say, though, that it is no walk through the park. The language is difficult, and while there is not a lot of explicit work, you need to study A TON. Anbo is a wonderful teacher, and the class became really close.","A bit demanding at times as you learn more advanced grammar and nuanced vocabulary but overall very fun. Assignments are good practice. Professor (Anbo) amazing as always!","I've you've taken ASL II or have the equivalent background knowledge, take this class! Anbo is an incredible teacher who really cares about his students. I've learned so much in one semester not only about the language, but about Deaf culture as well, and I had many of my preconceptions challenged. Also, try to stay caught up in the ASL book so that you aren't cramming before assessments!","TAKE THIS CLASS. TAKE IT. NOW. Ling73B has been unlike any other class I have taken at Harvard. The merits of the course cannot be overstated. In this class, I have been challenged linguistically, mentally, and emotionally in the most rewarding of ways. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just learn ASL grammar and vocabulary; we also learn about Deaf culture. Taking ASL at Harvard has changed the way I view the world. The professor is one of the most passionate, knowledgeable, and thoughtful individuals I have ever met. YOU WILL NOT REGRET TAKING THIS CLASS. It is not easy, but if you pay attention in class you'll be fine!","This class is amazing. ASL 1 and 2 have by far been my favorite classes at Harvard. Anbo is a fantastic teacher who cares about his students and making sure they understand everything and feel comfortable in class. The class is structured in a way where it is just an immersion into a culture and a language. Highly recommend!","Anbo is one of the best professors you will probably ever meet in your time at Harvard and to learn from his is such a worthwhile and amazing experience. To not take this class is a waste of your time here at Harvard-- it introduces you into a language and a culture that is really underrepresented in academia. Two things, though: 1) do not take this class as an \"easy\" class. It is not. It is learning an entirely new language and is more difficult to learn out of class because of the lack of traditional \"study\" methods. Also, to take it not out of interest is to deprive other students of a rather popular yet limited class. 2) THIS IS A LANGUAGE. THIS IS A LANGUAGE. Harvard is incredibly prejudice and does not see it as that. Keep in mind that, when taking this class, you are learning a LANGUAGE. That sort of change in attitude is wildly important. \r\nHarvard is pathetic for not recognizing this as a worthwhile language class. This embarrassment of an institution and its administrators should all take this class in order to see the benefits it brings."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.90","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"11","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
