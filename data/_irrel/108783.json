This course gives students a fascinating introduction to the theory and research that has been conducted on neighborhoods and urban issues while teaching students the analytical ArcGIS and statistical tool set necessary to explore these issues. This course was skillfully designed and really provides students with a holistically engaging experience. Each class session begins with a discussion of the research literature we have been reading, and then we transition into learning about a specific tool or skill in ArcGIS that will enable us to explore some of these issues on our own. This class represents the perfect fusion of theoretical knowledge and practical skill-building, and it really gives students a wonderful opportunity to learn about the community of which they are a part. Over the course of their undergraduate experience, every student ought to engage thoughtfully and meaningfully with the community of which their college is a part. This class equips students with both the theoretical background and the practical skills necessary to engaging with the city of Boston in a meaningful way and to really take ownership and initiative over an intellectual pursuit in the form of the final project. Everything we learn in this class is interesting and relevant. This course ought to be offered again and again because every student ought to have the opportunity to take a class like this one.","It's a very interesting way to learn about Boston and to learn GIS! The opportunity to do research with city data and then present findings to the city was interesting, and definitely motivating!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.25","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.25","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOCIOL 157","course_id":"4668","cat_num":"88434","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOCIOL 157","course_id":"4668","cat_num":"88434","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOCIOL 157","course_id":"4668","cat_num":"88434","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
