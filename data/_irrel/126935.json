'10":{"comments":["Prof. Mills is absolutely phenomenal! I even took her to my Student-Faculty dinner. She makes this class so much fun, despite the 4 hours of meeting a week. The class is laid back and a great way to meet people in a new setting. Our entire French class became really close, and we all really have a great time in class. There is a lot of pop media incorporated in class and we rarely (if ever) work out of the book in class. Take the class with Prof. Mills; she's amazing!","I really liked the teacher and it was fun to have a class where I can make up crazy\/creative things to say and\/or write about. I also feel so much more proficient in French. I enjoyed this class so much that I am planning to take French every semester for the rest of my time at Harvard.","Ms. Mills is an excellent teacher.","This course was my favorite of the semester.  The online social networking project was interesting and gave a sense of how applicable learning a foreign language is.","This is an amazing introductory French class. Professor Mills made the class entertaining and informative all at once.","It's very fun and painless way to learn French","The professor is really awesome and makes learning French fun. Tests aren't extremely difficult. I'd say the most nerve-racking part was French oral exams, but they were one-on-one so they were't too bad. Overall a great class that really helps improve speaking and writing skills.","an enjoyable class which makes it easy to learn a new language.","Definitely take this class if you plan to pursue the french language. I learned a lot in this course that wasn't covered in the very few years of french that I took in grade school.","The course is interesting and rewarding as long as you put the effort into it.","This course truly taught me to begin to think in French. It gave me not only knowledge of the French language but also confidence that I could actually speak it. This course had a great balance of speaking, listening, reading, writing, and presenting. I loved the way the class was taught in a small, comfortable setting. The classes were focused on a different topic each week... I appreciated that we not only learned grammar and vocabulary, but we also learned how to apply it to actual conversations.","It's an awesome course, make the best out of it by participating in class.","Study verbs and grammar at least once a week."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["David Stidler is the best!","Exactly what you need if you want to learn how to speak, read, and write French.","Take it if you really want to learn French. It's not very difficult, and you'll learn a surprising amount.","The quality of the class is dependent on the instructor. Nicole Mills is a very talented French instructor and you can't go wrong learning French from her!","If you really have the time to put in the daily effort for the class then go right a head! Get in Caroline's section!!!","The most important thing you can do in this course, more important than going to class even, is to speak the language outside of class as much as possible.","Your performance will be directly correlated with the amount of time you invest in it.","French Ab is a great course - just be prepared to devote a considerable amount of time to it each week!","So hard.. so many different tenses.","This class is hilarious because you get to make a French facebook avatar for the duration of the semester. I chose to make my character a guy (and I'm a girl) so it was all very fun to play around and make up drama on facebook with everyone else in the class' characters.","Expect a lot of constant work.  This definitely took me by surprise.","A great course with a fun theme that really brings everything that we've learned in class together in context.","The class is harder to do well on that in other language courses, but if you put in the necessary amount of work and practice a lot in addition to the homework, you will learn a lot of French! The class was a lot of fun.","This class is a great course with fun teachers. It is well structured, and is there is not an overbearing amount of work.","Work hard! Work every day! It makes it a lot easier if you are constantly working on your French instead of cramming or taking many days off at a time. It makes it a lot harder to jump back into it if you don't work on your French almost every day.","The class is enjoyable, but there are many, many assignments.","Unfortunately its the only way to start learning French, which is a great language. But the course was poorly designed in 2011 and I hope the class has been heavily changed.","It's a fun class, but sometimes going to class four times a week gets really old.","It is incredible how much one learns and is able to achieve after this course. I can now certainly understand most written and spoken French and attempt to speak with correct grammar myself and with a very rich vocabulary.","Love this class! Love Prof. Mills! You learn a lot of French at the end of Ab!","This class is awful, Nicole Mills is an incompetent course head.","Strong introduction to a language with a tremendous history and culture","if you want to learn french, take this class. Take it with David or Professor Mills if you can. They are super helpful and approachable, and make it easier to speak up in class, even if you are afraid of making mistakes, and practice is essential in learning.","Even if French turns out not to be  your thing, a fun and painless course that gives you some basic French speaking skills.","It is a really fun class with a lot to apply to your life in the french speaking future","Fantastic class, you learn a lot of French","The class is fun and very manageable if you take the time and effort to keep up with the work and activities on a daily basis as well as make efforts to practice speaking.","The class provides a window to French language and culture through challenging, but fun exercises. It creates an atmosphere where when you can have fun with it, you learn more.","Its a fine, but not altogether engaging class."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This class is a very fun and engaging class. Not only does it help improve your french but, it will also teach you to love the language.","Very fun and engaging class.  You will definitely make a lot of progress with your french!","This is a fantastic way to learn French. I was sceptic about language classes. I entered begrudgingly to fulfil a requirement but left very enthusiastic knowing a lovely group of people, feeling inspired by an incredible teacher and daily being surprised by the amount of progress I had made. Just commit the time to doing the work and the rest is not too difficult. I am not a particularly strong 'languages' person but the assignments are reasonable enough that you can make a good amount of progress with minimal suffering. It was a fantastic experience - pray to have Fracnk, he is quite legendary...","Make sure to be very intentional about the way you study the language: movies, practicing with others, and tutoring.","A great course for learning French.  It helped me out a lot.","French AB was so much fun! I looked forward to this class every day!","Great class and lots of fun - make sure you get FRANCK he's awesome!!!!!!!","You have to put in a lot of time outside of class to do well. I had a aprticuraly difficult time, I always studied for quizzes, but consistently did poorly. This class got frustrating towards the end. I think it can be wonderful, but you really need to dedicate a lot of time outside of class to it. The homework itself is easy, but you should do independent practice","Solid French intro class. Everyone agrees that Franck is a great instructor. So take it if you want to start learning French.","It gives whatever you take out it.","Take it with Franck rather than Nicole if possible!","Make sure you have Professor Mills. She is fantastic.","This is a great, fun class that accomplishes exactly what it sets out to! I went in having taken French Aa and made a lot of progress from there.","amazing course, interesting spin on learning a language"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["French Ab was my favorite class this semester!  Your speaking skills will improve!","This class is a lot of work. Be prepared to do work every day. You can pass with minimal work, but to get an A you will have to really put in the time and practice.","So much fun. A really great way to complete your language requirement!","I would definitely recommend the course if you want to continue french at a beginners level","If you want a powerhouse beginning French class (and have taken French Aa\/are already sort of familiar with the language), then definitely enroll in French Ab with Prof Mills. Take the class seriously and put in the necessary hours per week, and perhaps find a conversational partner outside of class, and you'll be fine. Exams are extremely fair--they're really there to help reinforce the material, not to throw you a curveball. The memoir projects can sneak up on you if you don't pace yourself (just know that they're always due the same week of the lesson quiz). But do have fun with the memoir project; it's a fun way to interact with the other students in the class. Just have fun with the assignments! They might seem like a lot of work initially, but when you step back and look at the class as a whole, you realize how carefully planned every assignment is; there's no \"busywork\" to be seen, and that's thanks to an airtight syllabus. Great course.","Extremely useful and enjoyable.","As long as you are willing to participate this will be a fun class. You have to really be committed though \u00e2\u20ac\u201d not that it's a lot of work, but there is a lot of class time and if you aren't interested in French you probably will end up unhappy with it.","The most effective way to study for this class is to keep up on the homework, doing a bit of French each day.","It's a good course that gives you plenty of practice speaking French and teaches you a lot of grammar.","Good class to learn basic grammar principles and begin to learn about french culture.","Do the nightly homework. It will not only save you from a rush to do it all before it's actually due but also will allow you to participate in class and enjoy yourself more.","This class is what you make of it. Some students improved a lot but some did not. It is very easy to do the work at the last minute if the class is not a priority for you.","I would encourage anyone interested in gaining a deeper, more intimate understanding of French both as a language and culture to enroll in this class. If you happen to be in Clement's section, the better your experience!","An excellent way to learn not only beginning French but also Paris and French culture! This course really inspires me to go study abroad in Paris next year just to have fist-hand experience of all the places and cultural aspects that we have been talking about in class.","French is the language of love, also it is a hell lot of fun to have a french-ish accent","French Ab is a great course. You will leave the course with a basic grasp on French grammatical structures and with a basic vocabulary. The class is never particularly difficult, but it requires consistent work; if you get behind, it will be difficult to do well in the course. While this daily work is good for learning, it (and the Monday-Thursday) section can get pretty tedious. \r\n\r\nAlso, a HUGE factor in your experience lies with the TF you get. I had Nicole Mills, and she was INCREDIBLE- literally perfect in ever way. Professor Mills gave incredible feedback, made section lovely, was extremely approachable (making you feel confident enough to test out bolder contributions in class), and even took our section out to a caf\u00c3\u00a9 for our last meeting. If you have Professor Mills, or any of the other good TFs (that I'm sure exist), you will have a great experience and learn a lot; if you don't have such a good TF, you may not enjoy French Ab.","This class is a ton of fun -- it teaches you about Paris and you learn all the French you'd need to get by day to day. This class gives you the base you need in order to go travel to France and get quite good.","I really enjoyed this class. I have had a wonderful experiencing with French classes at Harvard so far and would encourage anyone interested in French to consider taking a class. I feel that my ability to converse in French improved a great deal this semester, and I thought the Facebook project for this course was really fun and a great way to learn more about French culture.","You'll learn a lot more here in French AB but keep in mind you get what you put in. This class can be really productive if you're willing to speak, participate, and maybe do some things on your own.","It is a fun course, and you will surely learn a lot.","Learn the grammar and vocabulary on your own, there is not much review in class.","I really enjoyed this course and would recommend to anyone considering French!","Be sure to study beyond what is given to you to study.","The studying to essentially done on your own. Class time is used for practice actually using the language.","great class, keep up with your work then you will be fine","This class is great however requires a lot of in class and out of class work","really easy, just show up to class","This is a very good class. If you classmates are all interested in the simulated life in paris it even gets better","Though this course is quite intensive, it will give you a decent background in the French language and is a quick way to be able to speak and write basic French pretty well.","This class gives you an excellent basic knowledge of french. It is great for people who are looking to get a basic grasp of the language.","the course was very interesting as it put the course in the context of life in Paris","French Ab is an excellent course, though not the easy A that some may imagine it is. Class is taught is small sections of 12-16, and this provides plenty of opportunity to speak and write the language, and receive feedback. The course moves rapidly, and there doesn't seem to be a break in the constant (but manageable) work. If you get behind, it is hard to catch up. The grades tend to range between 88-93 for every assignment, and it is very difficult to earn anything higher than that. Francois is an excellent TF (better than any other from what others have told me). Overall, you will learn a lot of French if you put in the effort, but may not get the \"A\".","The class depends on which TF you get. So some sections will be a lot harder than others.","Great environment to help you feel confident with french.","Just take it. This course is fun and engaging, and is much more rewarding after you've taken Aa in the fall. The only caveat is that it needs constant practice and work. Do the readings everyday, don't let work pile up because the course moves pretty fast, and you learn a great amount of vocabulary and grammar. Practice them, keep track of grammar especially. Speak it too, that helps in the orals. Also, if you can, take it with Franck!","It's great if you really want to learn how to speak french someday.","Great way to learn the language without a huge time commitment. An important step in your French career at Harvard.","Professor Mills is incredible. She is overflowing with enthusiasm for both the language and the culture, and making intro language--which can be extremely dull--really fun. She also obviously really cares about her students and work really, really hard to make sure that everyone in the class is engaged and learning.","The French TF's are great! They are friendly, willing to help, and committed to helping their students learn French. I never took a French class in my life, but through this class my fluency has greatly increased. I originally took this class as an elective, but I loved it so much I decided to continue and obtain a language citation.","Yes you come out of Ab knowing considerably more French than you learned in Aa. However, please know that this class is very time consuming and you must be willing to put forth the effort required to do well in the class and really learn the language. At times, the class can be tedious and a pain to take.","It is a lot of work, but if you enjoy French, it is very enjoyable.","French Ab is great, but plan your schedule carefully so you dont have to take it first thing in the morning!","As long as you do the work, and participate in section, this class should be no problem. The grading is very fair, and section is a lot of fun. You'll get to meet a lot of your peers and learn a foreign language in the process. The teaching staff is incredible. You really have nothing to lose by taking this course!","Absolutely take this course, it is amazing how much you will learn in such an incredibly fun way. We got to pretend that we lived in Paris by making up characters that interacted with eachother through Facebook and memoirs. Everything is so welll knit together...even the quizes make sense in the \"pretend Paris\" role play. In one of then I found out that my character was getting married :) I LOVED THIS CLASS SOOOOOOO MUCH!For the last day of class she took us to Algiers (the cafe) where we were that table..yeap the really loud ones as we received little awards for our final exam theater project","This is a great French class for beginning French speakers to take.","This class is made or broken by the TF. Unfortunately, not all times have great section leaders. Some people love it and others don't. I had a great experience with my French Aa TF but a terrible one with my French Ab TF. Make sure to shop around about TFs and ask upperclassman or people.","This class takes a lot of memorization, but participate often and the language will soon become more natural and flowing.","I would tell future students that this class is great for someone who wants to take their French past the colloquial level and be forced to speak a lot in class.","an exciting class! If you do not already love France and in particular the Parisian life, then this class will serve as a very good introduction to it and it is amazing","If you're looking to fulfill a language requirement, go with Spanish. It's a lot easier than the French program.","This is a great class! Very fun and interactive!","It's a really fun class, and not especially difficult. I think you get out what you put in.","This class requires a lot of work, but it is not necessarily difficult. Just put in the effort and by the end you will speak French pretty fluently.","The instructors and material are generally excellent, but it is certainly challenging. Prepare for class and participate to enhance your pronunciation.","It was a bit difficult to understand what was going on a lot of the time and the explanations could have been better, but if you are extremely interested in French culture and learning the language, I suggest this course."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to take French and is at this level. It's worth taking if you want to learn French - I learned a lot.","This might be called a beginning french, but it is quite challenging especially if you have no practice in a french speaking environment. Need some background knowledge and if not just stick with French Aa.","This is a wonderful introductory French class!  The language classes here at Harvard are truly excellent!  In particular, Professor Mills is an excellent professor; engaging, enthusiastic, and helps you learn the course concepts smoothly and easily.  I definitely recommend this class!","Although there are assignments every day, I found that this course was one of my enjoyable courses this semester.","It is a well developed and organized course."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Take this class!  Creating characters and \"living in Paris\" for a semester is a great way to learn French and travel abroad a little bit each day.","Great class, pretty easy for a language course, though the work load does intensify dramatically during reading week. Otherwise, a great class!","French is a beautiful language to learn and this class makes the process of learning it enjoyable. There are several creative elements built into the class that encourage individual exploration of the language beyond what is taught in the class, which makes learning more fun. The work load is quite easy to manage even though it does meet everyday. After this class it is amazing to look back and realize how much you have learned. The teachers are incredibly helpful and you should take French!","French is a great language and applicable in a lot of different places.","Take a risk and do homework every night for this course because it will end up being fun and you will want to continue learning more.  Consistency in habit is most important.","It's excellent--it's as quickly paced as French Aa which is awesome, because you come out of the class really knowing a lot.","French Ab is a class with squandered potential. It covers several important tenses and grammatical structures, but spends barely enough time on them to show you the conjugation and then never returns to them. Instead, the course spends a litany of periods on cultural things, such as Parisian neighborhoods and movies. I left this class with the basic ability to work french, but if I hadn't had a background in spanish to crutch on I would have been even more lost in this course. If you really want to know the grammatical concepts, expect to spend a lot of time outside of course learning them yourself beyond the brief introductions the course gives you.","It's a really well structured course that is a really nice staple to have in your schedule. It does meet a lot, but it's really effective in getting you to a new level in the language and then there isn't too much work each night. I also found it really interesting in particular learning about Parisian culture.","Definitely take french ab if you've already taken french aa or have some background in french. I didn't enjoy french ab as much as french aa since the course tried to cover too much material. Most people I talked to about it felt like they didn't retain anything, and it is hard to remember the endings for conjugations of verbs because there's no time for anything to sink in. That being said, it is about the same level of difficulty as french aa (which wasn't very difficult), so it's not a stressful class, it's just frustrating at times.","This course is challenging, but also very fun. Even though I found myself pushed outside of my comfort zone when it came to speaking and writing French, I am glad that I was able to take this course! It is very well organized (the powerpoints, presentations, activities, and exams are all very engaging and fall under clever\/unified themes).","I STRONGLY recommend taking a language class at Harvard even if you've already completed your language requirement. On top of that, I strongly recommend taking French, because this simply one of the best language departments in the school. I hated language classes in middle\/high school, so it was surprising to me that French ended up being far and away my favorite class. I'm planning to continue learning French because, considering I started in French Aa in September with little knowledge of the language and can now (8 months later) hold debates about modern art and religion, I am looking forward to seeing how improved my French will be after two more semesters.","make sure you stay on top of the work.","Language programs at Harvard are great, and the beginning French faculty are especially great. The class is not at all difficult and yet the takeaway is tremendous! You learn a lot very quickly!","You spend SO much time on this class. In addition to class 4 times per week, you have class during reading week, and have a final oral exam, and you put on a play. The play makes you feel as though you are in the 5th grade, and it is so unnecessary. In addition, you write the script with other people, and you spend HOURS during reading week preparing for it. The French department forgets that you have other classes.","I think this course was a great course to take freshman year. The course is not high workload and the workload is spread out pretty well.","It's an incredible and fun class where you make A LOT of progress after French Aa and really improve your speaking skills, but be prepared for a lot of grammar!","n\/a","I personally took this exclusively to fulfill my language requirement and will never be taking a language class again as long as I live. If you love languages, take this course by all means.","Really improved my speaking skills","French AB builds on french AA, and is a great course. The instruction is first-rate with native french speakers, and the course is well organised in its structure. The pace is fast, but if you study the material each week you will be fine. If you've ever wanted to learn french, then now is a great time!","You're going to learn a lot! If you enjoy French, you will enjoy this class. If you don't, your opinion about the language will probably not change. It's a lot of busy work, and grammar.","You can greatly improve your language skills even beyond the level required for the course if you put in the time to practice what you learn in class. It is a very enjoyable and stress free course.","It's a fun class! Take it, but make sure to memorize all of your punctuation, tenses, etc. for the quizzes.","Super useful! Definitely take it","It's a very fun class and you continue to improve and become more confident in speaking French, as well as writing \/ reading in French.","It can be monotonous, and there is a lot of busy work. Still, it certainly does progress your language skills significantly.","Marion is amazing, and the class is so creative and fun. Not a huge workload, but you'll be surprised at the end of the semester how much you've improved.","French Ab is slightly harder than French Aa, but it is a very similar structure. I've noticed that French tends to involve more work than other romance language classes (i.e. Italian, Portuguese)","Work each day rather than leaving the homework exeecises till the end of each two-week period.","This is a great class. You learn a lot, and if you stay on top of your work (and actually do the assignments as they are listed) it's pretty easy to do well. Also a lot of fun learning about Paris!","I think you probably already know if you need to take this course or not. It's the second introductory French course. It's an excellent course, it's run smoothly, you'll learn a lot, all the teachers are wonderful. If you want to learn French and have taken Aa, you'll want to take Ab.","You will get out of it as much you put into it. This not a class where you can passively learn.","If you do the work, you really will learn a lot. I'm amazed by how much my French has improved after such a short time.","The syllabus might sound exciting, but when you get into class you find you learn little (they will try and teach a little about french grammar, in French, which somewhat defeats the purpose), you waste 5 hours of mandatory class a week, when you learn everything outside of class, oh and you can't miss class because the head of the course will throw you out (Prof. Mills is not a very nice woman). Got an A in the class in the end, but I would recommend jumping to a higher French or better yet, learn a better language (France is a shrinking power).","We go extremely fast paced through virtually all of the grammar structures and tenses in French. Class is pretty boring, I gotta say, especially by the end of the semester. But it's not terrible.","French Ab is an efficient way to continue your French education. In order to master the material you must be willing to be involved in class. You must converse with your fellow classmates and be unafraid to make mistakes. It's a very enjoyable atmosphere.","This is a great class for anyone who wants to improve their speaking and writing skills and to become familiar with a wide variety of tenses. That said, the workload is consistent and fairly demanding, in terms of time.","My section is just way too big. I barely know the name of half of my classmates. Google+ assignments seem superfluous (also who uses Google+??). Samuel is a very nice TF.","A wonderful course. There are several instructors for this course, so the quality may vary, but ours is kind and enthusiastic.","This course really focuses on the Parisian culture, but it also allows you to form more complex sentence structures both in writing and speaking.","I would say that this class should be taken if you have a genuine interest in learning the French language, reading French documents\/literature, or traveling to France.  It's a lot of work, and although the work isn't extremely difficult, the amount of work can sometimes be a bit overwhelming.  That being said, it was quite enjoyable overall and I would say that French is a great foreign language to learn at Harvard."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Amanda is a wonderful teacher. She is energetic and really knows how to teach a beginners' language class, which is not an easy feat.","French Ab is a great class for beginning french students with some basic French language skills under their belt.  Your enjoyment of the class however is highly TF dependent.","By far my favorite language class!","If you like the French language and the French culture, you should definitely take this course. It is easy, funny and interactive and by the end of it your French skills will have improved a lot.","There was a play that we wrote and acted out for our final project this year instead of a final exam. That was awesome!","It's a ton of fun and a very educational course!  The workload is not too intense, but if you put in enough effort you'll get a lot out of it.","Kathryn is an excellent TF! She really helps you with pronunciation.","You should definitely take this class if you have some of a background in French and you want to improve.","Definitely my favorite class this semester! The course moves at a manageable pace and was structured in such a way that made learning French fun.","Great class, very little work and you begin to learn a language very well.","learn french, yo.","At least in my class, there was a really great atmosphere created by Kathryn.  Because it was relaxed I felt myself and others were able to speak more confidently. It was a fun and helpful course and you end up becoming comfortable with the people in your class. Creating the alter french ego was fun and learning about Paris is a motivating way to learn french. Take this course if you have a few years of high school french but you're not very comfortable with the language!","Kathryn is an amazing teacher. The quality of teaching in the French department is really extraordinary. I can't believe how much I have learned in just two semesters.","I am not a fan of language courses so it was never going to be my favorite class but it did it's best and was a positive experience.","So amazing, fun, dynamic, educational, and interactive! The teacher is amazing and the class really gets to know one another."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["I would say that taking French to satisfy the foreign language requirement is a good choice, as the content covered in both semesters is interesting. I would stress that they work on their pronunciation and accent early on, because that is what I struggled with most throughout the course.","This is an amazing class that I've been recommending to my fellow mid-career students (and succeeded in promoting it!). After two modules you are able to read books and understand a lot, you acquire the basic knowledge of the language and are fully prepared to upgrade. What you learn is French that is spoken today and the way it is spoken. The amount of work put into this class is amazing so every hour is full of cultural references, visual and online material, videos and exercises that really inspire you to study and start speaking.","You get out of this course what you put in. If you don't spend much time outside of class working on your French, you won't grow much as a French student.","Pretty easy language class, not much work","This course is fast paced yet gets you to learn the French language well.","Madame Mills is an excellent teacher and works hard to include everyone in the class through participation.","This class was so much fun! I looked forward going to class everyday because I knew that we were going to do something silly with the \"neighbors\". I thought the idea to make all the students neighbors who live in the same building was so much fun and it brought us closer as a class.","This is a great class! It's a painless and enjoyable way to get your language requirement done or to just take in general.","It's very fun, engaging, educational, and just an awesome experience.","this class was interesting and you learn a lot about french culture in this class. i learned a lot more in french Ab than i did in french Aa and I liked how we had to make up characters that all lived in an apartment because it made the class more fun. i learned a lot new grammar in this class as well, which was helpful and allowed me to form more complicated sentences.","It is helpful to have a background in Romance languages.","This is a good way to get your language requirement out of the way","French is a great choice--all the TF's are very helpful and the course really teaches you the language.","Don't be shy about speaking in this class - talking and struggling to piece together complicated thoughts about complicated issues is so important to the learning of a language. This course teaches you to be fearless about that.","THIS IS A GREAT CLASS TO TAKE TO IMPROVE YOUR FRENCH LANGUAGE SKILLS AND TO LEARN ABOUT AN INTERESTING CULTURE. THE STRENGTH OF THE INSTRUCTOR LARGELY DETERMINES THE EXPERIENCE YOU WILL HAVE IN CLASS. GREGOIRE IS THE BEST - SUPER PATIENT, KEEPS THE CLASS INTERESTING, AND IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL.","French classes are often highlights of my week. I just really love the language, and I love the style of the class to be so interactive not just with the teacher and the material, but also with your classmates. There's always a great class dynamic, and French is as fun as it is useful\/efficient in teaching you the language. I think that it's also really great that the French dept. doesn't just teach the students the language, but also teaches you about French and francophone cultures, since, ultimately, languages are so wrapped up in culture. Finally, I appreciate how organized it all is. Really makes a difference in your experience in the class. The teachers are really enthusiastic about the classes and also about various French club events happening, as well! There are always so many French-related opportunities.","If you don't like being dramatic, don't take it. It is beyond French.","seems to be harder than other common language such as spanish","French Ab is fun and dynamic. The character development over the course of the semester can seem silly at times, but it gives a nice common thread to the course. Mills is a fantastic teacher and returns assignments very quickly with plenty of feedback. Put time into the course, and you'll get a lot out of it!","This class is a lot of fun! There is much opportunity to speak and practice your french in a supportive environment. I really enjoyed being part of this class and Tali was an exceptional teacher.","It's wonderful, but it's time consuming due to meeting four times a week.","Take it, it's fun and you learn french. Yup.","although i only took the course to fulfill the language requirement i definitely come away w a strong grasp on th french language","The class is fun and better than learning straight from a textbook, but it's hard work keeping up with the amount of work they give you.","It's a pretty good course.  Just like French Aa, pretty hard to get an A."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This course is very engaging. Expect work everyday but nothing too difficult. Study for the quizzes and take your time writing compositions. Tuo is very enthusiastic and makes the course fun.","Hey, if you're like me and need to get a foreign language out of the way, this is a relatively painless way of doing it. Taking the time to prioritize getting the work done (and with it, the requisite practice in utilizing the language) can be difficult as the semester wears on and you're more involved in your other classes. It's not too hard to just coast, but we'll see if that comes back to bite me in French C.","Loved it SO MUCH. Amanda is the most amazing TF! Class is so much fun and my French skills improved drastically. I cannot believe how much my French has improved.","I took this purely for the language requirement after some high school experience and expected it to be terrible.  Honestly, it was relatively painless, and I came out being much more comfortable with my french than I was at any point in high school.  The curriculum is interesting, and it was certainly not as bad as I expected.","took this to fulfill the language requirement, did just that. cant say i particularly enjoyed it, but its all about what you put into the class.","It is fun and is efficient at teaching you moderate French","This was such a fun class- absolutely the way to go if you need a language.  The play at the end was really fun- Amanda Gann was awesome and made every class fun and engaging so I actually wanted to learn French.","Create a very unique character and really make an effort to post on Gmail! Also be creative in your essays.","Not as fun as French Aa but you go over a larger amount of material","Take this class--French is a wonderful language!

You basically have to live the life of a parisian. This can be a lot of fun if you have time to devote to developing your alter ego but if you don't have time, this can be very stressful and have a negative impact on your grade if you don't put in the effort.","This class is fine if you need to take your language requirement, otherwise there are definitely classes at Harvard you will learn so much more from","The level of cultural integration could be irritating to those who just want to get a language requirement out of the way. Students in the course had to create characters, set up a social media account, create hypothetical living situations, and, at the end, create a final play. Although this may seem like a bit much at first, I will say that by the end of the course, I appreciated the fact that the course was set up to be as engaging as possible. Having Jonathan as a such a great TF definitely made the course less stressful\/more enjoyable. That being said, transitioning from French Aa to Ab might be challenging at first because four verb tenses are learned rather than two.","Stress-free way to learn a new language","You need to work hard for this class, but your work will be worthwhile.","it is too time consuming","A great way to learn French. Writing and performing a play was, however, a bit overwhelming and unnecessary.","Do homework and practice outside of class with tutor or at language tables to master fluency and thought in French language","If you're looking to just satisfy your language requirement, I would suggest a different language.","Jonathan Solarte made a boring French Ab class very fun to be in.","It's a lot of work but you will learn a lot. Prof. Mills makes learning really fun and rewarding. She is helpful and always willing to meet outside of class.","This class is much MUCH better than French Aa. You actually have the proper foundation to learn much more. I really enjoyed the french culture component, and there was no final exam. You learn a ton in the last part of the semester, so not having a final was a big relief.","So the role-playing component of French Ab is a little weird, but it can be really fun, too! There was no written final-- we performed a play with a group of 3 in front of the class. Plus, my preceptor did not make us memorize it, so it was a pretty chill, fun performance! Participate and it will be a good time!","A fun course, but more work than anticipated!","if you're willing to put the work in, you will learn a ton of french. If not, you won't. It's pretty much that simple.","French Ab lagged for me compared to French Aa. Get Nicole Mills, as your TF, if it at all fits your schedule. She is far and beyond the best teacher in the introductory French classes. Try to not get a native French speaker, is my experience, if you find it hard to keep up on your own because they will not know which aspects non-natives (the whole class) find difficult.","JONATHAN SOLARTE IS AMAZING.","Unfortunately, you might need to take this class.  You might think French, for its linguistic similarity to English, would be an easy way to fulfill your language requirement.  Well, it might be the easiest (I can't compare it to other courses), but it certainly isn't simple.  This class gets caught up in conversation and culture, meaning if you want to understand what's happening you need to teach yourself the language.  My advice? Take a semester abroad and get out of taking language.","Great class! Well taught, and quite useful.","It really sucks being forced to take a language you are not interested in because its a requirement","It's worth taking if you're trying to learn French. I thought I learned a lot during the semester. There is an unreasonable amount of busywork and you'll have some sort of assignment every week, but never any amount that will take you a huge amount of time. It's the same amount of work (maybe a little more) as a normal class, it's just spread out over the entire semester instead of concentrated in a couple exams or papers.","It's a lot of work","If you want to have a decent understanding of the French language in one year, you will absolutely have that after completing French Ab.","French Ab is terrific as a course, but your experience depends a lot on your preceptor.  I would highly recommend Mme Mills -- she's incredibly helpful, kind, knowledgable, and patient.  Altogether, she's one of the best foreign language teachers I've ever had.","Be wary of Dr. Mills, but other than her, the course is amazing!","As long as you keep on top of everything going on, this class can be fairly enjoyable","If you practice, this will likely be your favorite class.","French Ab really takes the time and care to immerse you in Parisian life - increasing cultural awareness while teaching grammatical concepts.","French Ab is not as exciting as French Aa.","This class is very helpful with learning French","This class is a great way to learn French, but if you are not artsy, beware! The class requires you to be very creative, including writing and acting in a French play, interpreting art, and writing creative pieces.  If you are artsy and love things like that, this class is perfect, but if you are a terrible actor, this class is difficult.","Probably better taking Spanish, I hear it's easier. Or Yoruba.","French is a great fun language to fulfill the language requirement or take as electives.","This class is ridiculous.  It asks way to much from the students for an intro language class - compare with Spanish Ab or Italian Ab to see the difference.  The google+ profiles, characters, and emphasis on Parisian neighborhoods instead of grammar is frustrating, if not unnecessary.  Pay attention to the syllabus as the final is composed of a video component over which you have no control, a 15 minute conversation, and a 2000 word play that you write and perform at the ART.  By the end of this course, I was so done with the class that I stopped even trying to learn and just focused on getting the assignments over with as soon as possible.  Nicole Mills is also largely unhelpful with conflicts or concerns that you may have during the class. I would not recommend this to anyone who isn't dying to learn the language.","This class is a bit unorganized due to its top down construction, and as a result can be quite difficult sometimes, especially during French Aa, but you will walk away knowing a lot of French.","This class can be fun but the work is sometimes tedious. It isn't difficult but just requires a bit more work outside of class in order to be successful.","This class is mandatory, but I really enjoyed the characters we had to create and the compositions we had to write. We receive too many handouts though and many times I thought going to class everyday of the week was pointless.","It's honestly just a language course that you'll probably have to take if you want to fulfill your language requirement with french, and it's not a hard class at all because French isn't a hard language, but be prepared for a lot of different assignments that will take up time.","A great language class to take, adequately challenging and you will end the year with a solid beginner grip on French.","This class will definitely improve your French, but is a surprising amount of work!","This class is definitely a fun class worth taking!","I personally enjoy French a lot, so if you like French take this class because you learn a lot.","To do their homework on time and read the textbook\/memorize the vocabulary outside of class","It's very similar to other introductory language classes- time consuming and irritating. However, it's not a bad class. If you're looking for a language requirement class, might as well.

I'd say go for it!","Very well-taught and well-structured class; slightly more work than French Aa, but you'll learn more, too. A pleasant and rewarding semester of French!","Take it - it's really fun!","Only take this class if you really want to learn French or if you have background in French and need to fulfill language requirement. If you are on the fence don't take it. You will have so many useless assignment you will feel like you are in middle school. You will non stop talk about art and culture and never actually talk about interesting topics. You may learn the names of a lot of museums in Paris but really who cares? You will also be forced to create a Google Plus with a fake character. Oh yeah and class is four days a week. Avoid this class if at all possible. Don't let French aa fool you. This class is much worse.","Matthew is a great TF and he's very funny, making the class fun and engaging.","Great class to develop a base in French.","This is a good class. Really depends on who's teaching, but you decide how much you're gonna get out of it.","The course is very interesting but Bahij Tamer makes it exceptional. He is very patient, helpful and kind. I highly recommend joining his section.","It is a very time consuming class with a lot of work throughout the week - it is important to stay on top of things because every day builds off of material from the day before.","I think that the grading in French AB is harder than French AA; however, I feel like I enjoyed French AB more. Overall, French AB has less work than French AA, but you must spend more time on the assignments that they give. There is less of a focus on tests and much more of a focus on written and oral components.","One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard","Good class for a language requirement, especially if you enjoy French and Parisian lifestyle.","This class requires a good deal of role-play and character development, including a final play.","I really liked French Aa but found Ab to be extremely exhausting. The apartment building scenario was tedious to keep up with, and creating a script with a group for the final was unbelievably stressful. The teacher was great and just as amazing and helpful and kind as she was in French Aa, but the problem was with the setup of the course (the apartment building scenario and other out-of-the-box projects like this). It was just extremely and unnecessarily stressful.","The projects in the class are geared towards speaking.","If you would like to be conversational (granted, at a basic level) in French and familiarized with French culture, this course is great. Though I plan to continue with French, had I planned to stop after AB, I would feel that it was time well spent.","This is a great continuation of French AA and is a lot more interesting. It exposes you to a lot of cool French media and allows you to be very creative in the learning process. Highly recommend if you want to study French at Harvard.","You will learn a lot of French very quickly.","This class will really help you learn french and the french culture.","This is a great course overall. It covers a lot of material quickly, but it well supported and the activities are fun. It can be a lot of work (many assignments) but it is not too hard and they do a great job making the work enjoyable and useful.","If you want to learn french, in this course you WILL learn french. It's not difficult and you learn so much!","It isn't a useful class unless you can devote a lot of time to it, so unless you are an extremely disciplined student or someone with a lot of language background, don't take it during in conjunction with a particularly heavy course load.","This class will accelerate your knowledge of French must faster than you think, while also exposing you to Parisian culture.","A lot can be gained if one puts in the necessary work (but don't just leave it here, or else you'll forget most of what you've learned), and it provides a somewhat different type of course to others likely to be taken - one which can be quite fun."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["This is an opportunity to improve your understanding of french culture and language.","Great opportunity to cultivate your skills in beginner French!","J'aimais cette classe","Great class to balance a semester's schedule.

You won't regret it.","Take it if you enjoy exploring the French culture and learning more about the Parisian lifestyle. Also, we had to write a play instead of having a final exam which I thought was way more fun -- would definitely recommend this class if you love French culture or need to fulfill your language requirement!","If you can, definitely take the class with Professor Mills. Her enthusiasm for the course made the biggest difference and made me excited for class everyday!","It was very fun and I learned a lot of French surprisingly fast.","If you are invested in the class, you'll get a lot out of it.","I would say that it is a basic language class, but it is not as easy as people would think.","The course is very well structured and weekly schedules will allow you to always know what's coming up.","This course is perfect if you are a beginner and are interested in becoming conversational in French.","It's an amazing class that will cause you to have a working knowledge in French if you apply yourself. At times the pacing can be difficult if thinking in foreign languages is not a strength, but otherwise this course is well developed, well taught, and a lot of fun! Note: Also a lot of work.","Be prepared for a lot of work!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"4.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"45","response rate":"75.56","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRENCH AB","course_id":"4375","cat_num":"126935","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"21","5s":"14"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRENCH Ab","course_id":"4375","cat_num":"28075","1s":"3","2s":"8","3s":"25","4s":"6","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRENCH AB","course_id":"4375","cat_num":"126935","1s":"3","2s":"31","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
