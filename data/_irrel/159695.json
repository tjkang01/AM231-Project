We learned about the development of novel therapeutics for 5 CNS diseases in addition to the mechanisms and symptoms of the disease.  The workload is manageable with 1 or 2 1 page papers on the clinical research due each class as well as 2 presentations.  Catherine is an enthusiastic and knowledgeable teacher with experience and connections to drug development and biotech companies.","Catherine is amazing! You need to take this class. That's it. Just take this class immediately.","THIS CLASS IS THE BEST. SO INTERESTING. EVEN WRITING THE PAPERS WERE INTERESTING. ALL DISCUSSIONS WERE INTERESTING. OMG TAKE THIS CLASS oh wait you'll probably have a different professor so I don't know how it'll be","It's so sad this class won't be offered anymore it was really great to see the new advances in some of the most difficult neurological disorders to deal with. Writing novel therapies was a really rewarding experience and delving deeply into the neurobiology of these disorders was great. Catherine is a great professor who was very flexible and willing to work with your ideas.","Unfortunately there won't be future students I dont think, but i wish there were because its a great class. Of all my classes at Harvard ,this was my favorite because I never felt like it was a burden; I was constantly learning about diseases of the brain and cutting edge technologies, which to me, is really awesome.","This course is a great way to learn more about several neurological diseases and the current research and therapies for these diseases. It is also a great way to learn more about how to evaluate whether a potential therapeutic will be safe and effective, and provides a deeper appreciation for the nuances involved in developing and selecting therapeutics. However, this course is a very clinical course, and there is much less focus on reading basic science papers or learning about basic science experiments. Overall, though, this is a great course with a small number of students, allowing for productive discussions."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"3.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101B","course_id":"13853","cat_num":"159695","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101B","course_id":"13853","cat_num":"159695","1s":"2","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
