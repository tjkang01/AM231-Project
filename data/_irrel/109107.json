Grasping that understanding led to a better appreciation of my faith. If you are an atheist and hope to understand the phenomena that is God and Christianity while improving your writing skills, this is the course for you. if you are a person of faith looking to understand more about Christianity, this course provides academic insight and is taught by an incredibly helpful\/understanding professor.","From what I heard from upperclassmen, this expos falls in the middle of the road between terrible and fantastic. I regret that the subject matter was not as exciting as I thought it would be but I did enjoy the opportunities and collective\/small group idea sharing.","I have no idea what this course will be like next year, as so much of it depends on the teacher. This was definitely an EXPOS course people took to get through and didn't savor.","There are probably much more interesting topics than this one for Expos.","If you are interested in Christianity and Christian authors' writings, take this course. It's wonderful, Dr. Syba is an excellent preceptor, and you'll learn a lot. The weekly readings are relatively short in length and are completely manageable, and the essays are spaced out well. The feedback on all the essays and drafts is thorough and helpful. I definitely recommend those who are interested in Christianity to take this course.","This course really opens your mind and forces you to question any assumptions you may have regarding religion. All the subject material is fascinating. It will definitely strengthen your ability to find evidence and analyze it specifically and skillfully.","This class was fairly interesting at times, but incredibly disjointed. Hard to navigate if you don't have a background in Christianity. I've heard a lot of bad things about Expos, and this class was fair, so it might have been one of the better ones.","It is a difficult topic, but very interesting. Make sure to do the readings!","DON'T TAKE IT. It is NOT really about Christianity-it's about fringe interpretations of new sects and random blogs."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.33","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.25","recommendation":"3.25","enrollment":"12","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.213","course_id":"1745","cat_num":"68701","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"4","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 20.213","course_id":"1745","cat_num":"68701","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.213","course_id":"1745","cat_num":"68701","1s":"2","2s":"8","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
