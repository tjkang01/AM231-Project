He has taught at Harvard since the 1950's and studied under some of the most well known German religious theorists. It is an honor to get to take a course with someone so brilliant. He has been on the forefront of New Testament studies for the past three decades. You won't regret taking a course with him. If you are at all interested in Christianity and its beginnings and are willing to put in extra work outside of class to integrate, review, and understand the complex historical and theological material--then you will have a great experience.","A good and very informative class overall, but the vagueness of the assignments makes me somewhat hesitant. It's very difficult to know how you're doing throughout the class, especially since only the final is a \"real\" grade.","Professor Koester is incredible. Being able to talk to him every week is one of the best parts of the course. Still a great and exciting lecturer even at his age. Take a course with him if you have the chance."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 1454","course_id":"11235","cat_num":"58387","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RELIGION 1454","course_id":"11235","cat_num":"58387","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 1454","course_id":"11235","cat_num":"58387","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
