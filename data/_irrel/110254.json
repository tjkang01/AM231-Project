The subject material is fascinating and I would wholly recommend this class to anyone interested in religion or American studies. It is surely not an easy course and there is a good deal of information to absorb for the exams, but the instructor is such a wonderful teacher and storyteller that it would be a shame to miss this course.","While I really enjoyed this course, I do believe that background in the field is extremely necessary to fully understand the subject material.","Lecture was like storytime twice a week - expert narratives from the articulate, funny David Holland - interspersed with great class discussions. The paper assignment was tough but necessitated reflection. Good to have background in Christian history but not necessary. Go to office hours with Travis!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"4.00","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 1518","course_id":"11409","cat_num":"96883","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RELIGION 1518","course_id":"11409","cat_num":"96883","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 1518","course_id":"11409","cat_num":"96883","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
