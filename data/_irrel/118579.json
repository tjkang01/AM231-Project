Even if you are not a VES concentrator you should consider applying to take this course as it really does challenge you to think differently than you may have to in other courses at Harvard.","I don't think this course will ever be offered again because Mike mentioned this would be the last time he'd be invited to teach at Harvard, but if any other unique photography class with a visiting professor comes around again, go take it because it's likely that they'll teach you what they know and do best--their method of making art.","If you're okay with and excited about the idea of not taking as many photographs and working outside of the standard framework of tradition, this is a good class for you. If you're looking for more technical aspects of photography and the photographic technique, this wouldn't be it. A lot of creative thoughts of presentation (e.g. book form) really expand anyone's photographic practice through this class."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["If you're interested in contemporary\/conceptual photography, this is definitely a class for you. Mostly it's a class about making art, which any intermediate photography class is going to be--there was a lot of freedom about allowing a final project to form throughout the semester, which was nice.","I love the open-endedness of this course. I planed my own projects, thought through my own ideas for photographs, and got to use so many incredible resources to create. Having linden street studios access is incredible, and also, being able to check out cameras, lenses, other technologies from John was so helpful."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"7.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 147R","course_id":"13555","cat_num":"118579","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 147R","course_id":"13555","cat_num":"118579","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
