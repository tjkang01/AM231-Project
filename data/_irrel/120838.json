This was partly due to the tiny size of our class, but also due to the fact that people were not into the readings so they hadn't done a lot of them and discussion dragged.  Professor Wilczek never cracked down, so the situation only worsened.  It felt like a war of passive aggression between us and him.","The readings may be long and seem overwhelming, but the papers are not too difficult, and the topic and discussions can be enjoyable.","Stay on top of readings, ask for help"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This course is a great way to learn about the time of the Berlin wall and what really was going on politically and culturally during the late 1900's in Germany. The best part of the course is that you gain access to interesting materials, including several films, novels, and short stories, that are challenging but not too difficult. The class discussions are great, and usually lively as long as you do most of the reading (of which there isn't all that much-less than 50 pages a week, sometimes much less). Thomas Herold is a great instructor, and I know he won't be teaching this course later, as he is leaving, but the subject matter is interesting and fosters lots of discussion.","This course uses really interesting materials, making it so easy to engage with and enjoy improving your German. Thomas was absolutely fantastic, and I looked forward to going to class, because it was so fun discussing the books\/movies with him. It went beyond simply improving German speaking\/writing skills, because he brought out the humor and interesting analyses of these works. Because the assignments were so interesting, it was easy to engage with, and between class time and the work, your German definitely improves.","Herr Herold's course requires a good amount of work, but it is incredibly rewarding.","This class had amazing readings, movies, and topics (DDR-Westerns, East German Punk, West German left-wing terrorism) and provided a nuanced perspective on the division of Germany that even a good history class in the US usually glosses over. Herr Herold is also an incredibly fun and devoted teacher. He makes class enjoyable, but he also provides enormous amounts of near-instantaneous feedback. Unfortunately, he won't be teaching it again, so it will likely be entirely different next time it's offered.","I would recommend with reservation NOT because that course is bad (I quite enjoyed the course, and Thomas is really awesome and chill while still professional and very helpful), but because the coursework was pretty heavy. Nearly every week, we had either an essay or revision due, and there was a LOT of reading for at least my level of German. HOWEVER, I thought all the reading and films were totally awesome and quite informative. I really enjoyed the course overall. I would just warn the person considering it that it's not your typical easy language course. You do have to put in effort.","I would recommend this course enthusiastically, but only because Thomas Herold is an excellent teacher in every way. Without him I think this course could be a shitshow, especially if the workload is not reduced, the class is large, or the students are poorly matched. Take note the first week to see whether your classmates are around your level of German, and take a good hard look at the syllabus for pages\/week and frequency of assignments. If everyone is about the same level and the workload looks challenging but not impossible, then you will learn a TON and have a GREAT time!!!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"5.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"20","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GERMAN 62","course_id":"2093","cat_num":"120838","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"3","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GERMAN 62","course_id":"2093","cat_num":"2201","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"11","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GERMAN 62","course_id":"2093","cat_num":"120838","1s":"1","2s":"8","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
