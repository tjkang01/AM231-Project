As a spring senior, there was no better way to tie together loose intelectual threads and finish up with something rewarding and conclusive.","This course offers a brilliantly creative combination of themes that circumnavigates a profoundly important theme that is otherwise difficult to legitimately handle: human attachment. The anthropological perspective Jackson provides throughout this process is equally unique and effective. This class is unlike no other, and if the theme is of interest it is impossible not to be impacted by the discourse that emerges from the course.","This is a fantastic class and you should take it if you're looking to gain perspectives on how the world can be understood and how to interpret its beauty and complexity. It is also a relatively fair work-load so is a high return for the amount of time that is required to engage effectively. All of the course staff is fantastic and there is a lot of room for growth."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This class was one of the most rewarding classes that I have taken at Harvard. I left section\/lecture each week feeling intellectually stimulated and more confident in my ability to contribute to thought-provoking discussions. Furthermore, Professor Jackson really cares about each student and is very encouraging.","I had a lot of good experiences in the Div school but this one was just okay for me. That said, the workload is great and I am a senior so it was just what I was looking for.","Jackson is a fascinating lecturer and a very interesting man. If anything, take this class to spend time with this brilliant guy!","Incredibly accessible interesting class, very easy course load aka one 5-8 page paper, will change the way you think about hthe world.","Very interesting, Jackson is a passionate professor with great insight on the material","Amazing class! Professor Jackson is very knowledgeable and TF Mariam made sections so enjoyable and this was one of the best classes I've ever taken at Harvard in my 4 years here, hands down. Lots of fun, lots of exciting material, very eye-opening class!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"17","response rate":"64.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 1017","course_id":"5040","cat_num":"108501","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RELIGION 1017","course_id":"5040","cat_num":"89684","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 1017","course_id":"5040","cat_num":"108501","1s":"4","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
