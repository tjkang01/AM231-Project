Come to the colloquium with real questions about how to make your paper better.","The methods tutorial is one of the best courses I took at Harvard. The workload is dense, but the coures is extremely rewarding. I got introduced to the various discourses and approaches to art history, which was not only interesting but also broadened my perspective and helped me to find my own style.

The course is a wonderful introduction to art-historical theory.","It's impossible to address this course without first mentioning Elizabeth. She is an amazing TF - fantastic at explaining complex concepts, facilitating discussion, and providing feedback on papers. She made the class engaging and exciting, despite its difficulty and the relatively heavy workload. \r\n\r\nAs for the material, after grappling with and studying all these methods, I felt like I could actually call myself a student of art history. There's a reason why it's required for all concentrators - methods lays the foundation for serious art historical scholarship. May be a bit painful (depending on your TF and the workload), but definitely worth taking. :)","Dear future student: You may get comments on papers such as \"totally confusing\", \"illogical\", and \"TURABIAN STYLE.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Sometimes you wonder if the essay you printed on this letter-sized paper is really the best use: no worries, Trent has gotten that covered by giving it a second purpose of testing the durability of his pen. Unfortunately, it has half ran out of ink in his hatches over your fifth paragraph. Still other times you are reminded that architecture (papers are included for a broad interpretation) is inherently political, and you are asked, \"do you agree with this glib, vacuous, fascist speech?\" But perhaps the most important lesson learned is that architecture is a subjective field, and your instructor is no more objective than his own views. In the swift span of two pages, he would credit the critics as \"accurate and valid,\" while dismissing the architects you quoted as \"total nonsense--what do you make of it?\"\r\nWhat I make of it, is that while Trent is an absolutely brilliant scholar, he is perhaps not the best (or most seasoned) instructor. By labeling sentences as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reductionist\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is to risk assigning malice where there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Attacking a quote that may not be the most politically objective as \"shallow mis-comprehension\" is to say that subjectivity is the bound of good academic writing. And you wonder why there is so much conformity in the dominant art narrative.\r\nAside from this, the readings are rich in concepts and well selected. The two drawing sets are the most fun to work on. Note that if you choose to go to Trent's office hours to discuss drafts, a well-cited comprehensive outline would not do. Rather, it must be in paragraph form to be worthy of being looked at. The in-class discussions are very enjoyable and the slideshow format is effective. I do recommend the class, as long as you know what you're in for.","This is a required class for art history majors, and the quality of the class depends on who is teaching it and the syllabus they've created. This specific methods class featured a lot of reading and writing, but that might change depending on who is teaching.","do the readings! put effort into the response papers!","Prepare to be challenged. If you prefer to be coddled in your academic pursuits, this class is probably not for you. With that in mind, this class was extremely influential in my development as a scholar, and could not imagine my semester without it. I developed a strong foundation not only in architecture, but in philosophy, politics, precolumbian architecture, various schools of thought, etc... If there are mixed reviews in the comments, I would take this as representative of the course's intensity, not to the quality of the course.","This covers a lot of material and can be challenging with the weekly responses. However, it provides you with a very solid foundation moving into more advanced art history courses.","It's hard to give recommendation because not only in this class required within the concentration; the TF changes. It has the potential to be a great learning experience and a chance to really improve your writing!","Trent is an excellent TF. You can tell that he really cares, especially when he tears into your writing. A lot of ink on the page may seem intimidating, but it is all helpful and well-intentioned. I learned a LOT and certainly improved as a writer. Solid class!"]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This course is difficult and often the workload is frustrating, but I feel I gained so much more in this class that I ever have at a class at Harvard. My ability to write and discuss improved exponentially; although the work was often long or boring I think this is one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Harvard.","As an art history student, you have to take this course.
