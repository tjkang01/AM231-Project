fantastic grounding in various prose genres of medieval latin texts.","This class made me want to get up every morning.  Even at 9 AM!","An excellent dip into late antique and medieval Latin; the principal text (Sidwell's Reading Medieval Latin) is well-organised, interesting, and fun to read all the way through.","With an interest in at least some aspects of medieval Latin, this course will provide a useful introduction to a variety of genres and texts."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["The course gives students a chance to practice and refine the Latin that they may already have learned, while also lending an insightful and useful overview of the literary, cultural and historical background of this particular period. Very useful for medievalists especially.","Fun and thorough introduction to Medieval Latin; good for Latinists of all levels; amazing and engaging professor."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["It's a great deal of work...and you'll get a great deal better at translating Latin quickly.","Medieval Latin is wonderfully different and sometimes more exciting than classical Latin.","If you need to translate Medieval Latin prose, it's obviously the best class to give you experience with that. If you have enough background in Latin, it won't be too difficult. However, simply be prepared for a lot of work, which will take a lot of time. The amount of material assigned is probably unrealistic, especially taking into account that most of it is never covered in class.","This was the worst class I've ever taken, whether in college or in graduate school. The TF Chris Parrott was completely out of touch with student ability, and downright hostile to any suggestions we would offer. The amount of work was incredibly unreasonable, typically requiring 13-15 hours a week. 2\/3 of the material we were tested on was not covered in class. Everyone was concerned about failing the final it was so unbelievable and unreasonably difficult. 2 of the 4 graduate students in my section dropped the course because they thought it was impossible to earn at least a B- (they were taking it sat\/unsat and hence needed at least a B-). I can not imagine a more terrible instructor or a more awful class.","Be prepared to work very, very hard, and to put a lot of time in doing the translations and studying for the quizzes.","This class takes a lot of time -- A LOT of time.","I know other students who took Latin in other areas outside the yard.  I feel like they had an easier time, but that I read cooler texts.  I don't know if they know Latin better or worse than me.  I would be hesitant to recommend Latin with the Classics department over these other programs' courses, but I would definitely let them know that my knowledge of the language improved dramatically.","taking this class was fun but it was a lot of work. I learned a lot because the format of the class required a lot of studying.","This is a difficult course, and don't count on learning translation skills in class; you have to teach them to yourself."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This is one of the best classes that I have even taken. One can learn Latin through the medieval culture looming behind the texts. Teacher is great: patient, kind and responsible. This is the class that can make the whole semester very enjoyable.","Medieval Latin is the best! Take this class and you'll get to translate a variety of interesting texts and play with really old manuscripts!"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["I think it is best if one prepares one's self for putting in a lot of hours. The class is at least 2x more than your average class in terms of hours that I think one should be prepared to put into it.","This is a great (and fun!) introduction to medieval Latin, and it is very helpful with your translation skills.  The amount of reading you have to prepare for each class is manageable, and the TF was super helpful.","This class is an excellent way to learn how to read Latin and translate it readily. My translation speed and accuracy improved dramatically in three months, though that improvement naturally required a lot of work. The medieval texts are fascinating, especially if one is interested in Church material."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["One thing to know about this class is that Jan--the course head--doesn't actually do the teaching; the class is taught by a TF. If you're lucky enough to have David as your TF then by all means take this. He's such an incredibly kind person who's devoted to  helping you get the most out of the material. Medieval Latin is weird and different, in content and in structure, from Classical Latin, but it's a cool window into a part of history to which you might not otherwise be exposed. And the middle ages were really important to the preservation of anything you might care about studying today--science, art, music, literature. If you want to read some Latin and try something different, Latin Bam is a fun and interesting way to do it.","Take this class if you are serious about latin\/romance languages. It's an excellent class and I learned so much history and latin from it. Be prepared to translate for at least an hour\/two hours a day, but it pays off. If you look up the vocabulary and try to translate the text before class, you will understand the material better it will be easier for you to get good grades. David was excellent and really help me when I was struggling to keep up in this class. Don't be afraid to speak up if you do not know what something is, and always ask questions. It will help you in the long road. Overall, I'm glad I took this class."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Make sure that you will be able to allocate between one and three hours (depending upon your Latin prowess) per translation assignment.  The course loses its value if you don't attempt the translations on your own.","This is an extremely intensive course, and needs a lot of hard work. But it's also extremely effective, so if you're really trying to improve your Latin, it's an excellent choice. It's also a good opportunity to read bits of authors like Bede or Abelard or Petrarch in the original, as they're often read in translation in literature courses."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":null,"difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"33.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LATIN BAM","course_id":"4999","cat_num":"120382","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LATIN Bam","course_id":"4999","cat_num":"7123","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LATIN Bam","course_id":"4999","cat_num":"7123","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
