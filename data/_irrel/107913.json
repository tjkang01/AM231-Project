If you enjoy reading fiction (mostly short stories) and are not immediately dismissive of the works of authors like Poe, I would recommend this class. Patricia Bellanca is very kind and earnest, and she will help improve your writing without placing undue emphasis on some checklist of elements.","Grading is very tough and its a lot of work, but its interesting","Just get through it and give it a chance.","If you like gothic fiction, this is a decent expos to take. Expos just sucks in general.","If you like fiction and are looking for a more open-ended expos that allows you to play with interesting ideas, I'd recommend taking this class.","This is a good course if you are at all interested in Gothic fiction as it allows you, to a certain degree, to write about what specifically interests you within this broad field.","This class is definitely not the easiest expos you could take, but is extremely rewarding.","Start reading and thinking early on! It will help you immensely come time for drafts and final revisions."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.30","recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"13","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.162","course_id":"11462","cat_num":"26805","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"7","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 20.162","course_id":"11462","cat_num":"26805","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"8","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.162","course_id":"11462","cat_num":"26805","1s":"0","2s":"10","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
