If you want to learn Irish, take this course, and you will learn it. Be aware that not only is the course load heavy, but the language itself is tricky; at times it will seem almost deliberately so. While the reward is ultimately worth the effort, don't go into the Irish program thinking you can coast.","This is a great language and really well taught class- It's definitely worth taking more than one semester."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This class was fantastic! It's very small so you get to know your classmates. Classes are fun and rarely feel like work, even while you're learning a considerable amount about a new and interesting language.","If you are interested in the Irish language, this is certainly a great class to take. But be ready to have to review very regularly throughout the course, as this class constantly builds on what has already been learned in Basic Irish. Nonetheless, the class is very interactive, there's a great teaching staff, and if you are willing to put the work in, it's a rewarding experience.","Irish is the most entertaining and satisfying (not that I feel spiritually uplifted, I just always feel really happy when I'm in the class) class I've taken at Harvard.  It's the only class I've never dreaded going to."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["The course is generally good, and if you've taken 132 you know what to expect from 133. Unfortunately, Irish is a very frustrating language, and the textbook really doesn't have much to offer in the way of insights.","Irish is a weird language, but if you want to learn a language that's not terribly practical but is fascinating and will guarantee lots of chances to ask any questions and know your instructor well, Irish is great."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["If you can, try to get in some Irish practice outside class"]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Taking Irish has been a great experience for me at Harvard.  The main attractions for me were that the class was so small and intimate, and that the Irish language and culture is super fascinating.  Those involved in the teaching of the course are genuine, passionate people that are a pleasure to be around!","Make sure you stay on top of the work and put in effort. The class is very fun and manageable if taken seriously."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"4.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"IRISH 133R","course_id":"454","cat_num":"119063","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"IRISH 133r","course_id":"454","cat_num":"6689","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"IRISH 133R","course_id":"454","cat_num":"119063","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
