I took it to learn more about Jewish history due to my Jewish background, and not only did I learn a lot about Jewish history, but I learned how to think like a historian. This course opened my eyes up to new perspectives, and the discussions were always lively thought-provoking! Definitely take it if you're interested!","Rena is a phenomenal instructor who challenged the class to think analytically and ask important questions about primary and secondary sources. The course offers students the opportunity to learn and engage with a variety of periods of Jewish history in several geographic contexts, identifying larger themes that connect these places and times and understanding the motivations and ideas of great historians of Jewish history."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 70k","course_id":"2323","cat_num":"19891","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 70k","course_id":"2323","cat_num":"19891","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 70k","course_id":"2323","cat_num":"19891","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
