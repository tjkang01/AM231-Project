While I have to confess that a few weeks I found the material a little dull and irrelevant (impenetrably, self-consciously \"arty\"), most of the stuff we studied was absolutely mind-blowing. Esp. the weeks on Minamata, Okinawa, and the Zainichi issue. And of course, Dr. Prichard is awesome :)","This class is awesome, and the professor is highly engaging and fantastic!!  Half of the class is spent watching documentary film media, and the remaining class time is spent discussing the film and readings that were relevant to that week's theme.  I would highly suggest taking this class if you have any prior knowledge of or an interest in Japanese history and documentary media.","The films, readings, and classes were fascinating\/engaging.  I thought I knew a lot about post-WWII Japan until I took this course and discovered that I'd only scratched the surface.  Professor Prichard did an excellent job giving cultural and historical context for the films, photobooks, and readings and really drew everything together.  I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in post-WWII Japan and\/or documentary film-making as a political statement.","Too often, films are discussed as isolated texts, without reference to their production and reception. The chance to contextualize experimental documentaries within the dramatic social, economic and environmental changes that gave birth to them deepened my understanding of both the materials and Japanese society in a way pure textual analysis never could.","This class is great for anyone who wants a different, thought-provoking perspective on issues concerning post-war Japan.","It's a wonderful course with fantastic material\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfiction, film, photography and readings. Professor Prichard's explanations bring everything together beautifully.","Prepare for your minds to be blown!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.75","workload":"2.12","difficulty":"2.62","recommendation":"4.75","enrollment":"9","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EAFM 120","course_id":"817","cat_num":"55056","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EAFM 120","course_id":"817","cat_num":"55056","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EAFM 120","course_id":"817","cat_num":"55056","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
