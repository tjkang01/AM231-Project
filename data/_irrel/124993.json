I absolutely loved the experience of being in the school with the children - it was a wonderful thing. However, the course itself was unclear at times and a bite frustrating. The teaching staff and the other people in the class were great, so I don't think it is anyone's fault. I think it is just the structure of the class as it currently stands.","The class is fantastic - you make great friends, practice your Italian, and the teachers are wonderful.  You just have to be prepared to be flexible - the teachers can sometimes be frustratingly Italian in their philosophy toward assignments and organization.","This class is a great opportunity to spend time with a group of people you might normally never interact with (the children). The class also provided the amazing opportunity to practice Italian in a completely different way.","It's good","This class is such an incredible learning experience!","Really fun, kids are so cute, not very structured","A great class that is both worthwhile in teaching Italian, but also makes you feel great.  The kids are amazing and the most incredible learners I have ever seen.  It makes the entire experience worth it to hear them greet you and talk to you as you come in using Italian!"]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["What promised to be a fun change of pace (teaching a language to little kids!) was in practice a poorly organized slackfest with the added unpleasant surprise of a final project announced halfway through the semester.","It's fun!","Do not take this class if you actually want to do something constructive with your time, although the spring is better, as there is actual teaching involved, but most of the time the class and assignments are disorganized, and everything feels completely futile."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This course still needs some tweaking, but if you are interested in education or in working with kids, it can be a lot of fun.","If you are interested in children's education, this course will be a great experience. If you are interested in improving your italian, probably not.","Great class! Get to interact with the community by teaching children between 5-6 years old Italian! Truly a fantastic program!"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["TAKE IT","This is a fun class and an good way to keep up your Italian in a non-classroom environment.","So much fun to work with and teach kids every week!"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This class is a fun way to engage with the community and interact with children in an instructive setting. I really enjoyed seeing their knowledge and enjoyment of Italian grow over the semester. That being said, this course is not well organized. The assignments, goals, and expectations for the course are not clear, and you hardly ever receive feedback. These aspects of the course made the experience frustrating for me.","Italian 96r is a really great alternative to more writing intensive Italian classes","Great class. Challenging and different, but so worthwhile.","It's a bigger time commitment than I originally expected, and things were pretty disorganized at times. I think a lot of it depends on who is in the class with you, because Patrizia left a lot of organizational work (perhaps too much) to the class as a whole. Much of the work is group work, which sucks when people don't pull their weight. I wish that at the end of the course Patrizia had given us a chance to evaluate our peers."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"2.67","recommendation":"4.17","enrollment":"7","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ITAL 96r","course_id":"4424","cat_num":"3749","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ITAL 96r","course_id":"4424","cat_num":"3749","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ITAL 96r","course_id":"4424","cat_num":"3749","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
