MAGGIE IS THE WORLD'S BEST PRECEPTOR AND THE COURSE MATERIAL IS REALLY INTERESTING.","Expos is probably going to be tough and war stories is a way to fulfil it whilst actually studying interesting material.","This is a really good expos choice. Compared to my friends, I had a very good experience. The readings were very interesting and not too long and the feedback on your essays was good too. The grading was not as harsh either.","I really enjoyed this expos class. The material is really interesting, the texts and films we read were really rich with meaning, and Maggie gives very good feedback. If you've heard a lot of negative things about expos, don't project those thoughts on this one. You can really get a lot out of the class if you want to improve your writing. Not everything we did in the course felt important or useful, but my writing improved after this semester and I really enjoyed reading some quality war literature.","In this class you will be exposed to many, very interesting works exploring war. The literature is probably the highlight. You will spend a lot of time trying to write for the teacher rather than exploring your own interests and the format is very structured of revision and editing which can be frustrating at times.","It's a great Expos class. You hear a lot of horror stories about it, but this one is genuinely one of the better ones.","This is a good expos class. That being said, it is still expos, so be prepared for pointless discussions, mandatory attendance and mind-numbingly boring essays. Basically be ready to repeat high-school writing in a slightly more irritating incarnation.","This is ONE OF THE BEST EXPOS SECTIONS that exists - if you like \/ are familiar with writing humanities style analyses (think high school english class work). The readings are great - Hemingway and O'Brien - and your final essay is about either of two good movies - Apocalypse Now or Zero Dark Thirty. So there isn't too much time you have to spend on the readings. More importantly, MAGGIE is TERRIFIC as a preceptor. There are probably other equally good ones, but I only know one, obviously, and there are also definitely some less helpful ones. She is super helpful, very devoted to making you a better writer, and generally great. She also runs class in such a way that the hour flies by and it's not a drag at all. I highly recommend this as one of the top 3 expos sections based on what I have heard and experienced.","Maggie is very helpful and energetic, and the books and movies were interesting. The reading can be a bit much, but it's nice to end on the movie unit"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"4.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"15","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
