It certainly provides a great deal of experience in working with texts, arguing for particular translations, and discussing the philosophy of translation with others. With a disclaimer regarding the current textbook and a somewhat subjective evaluative standard, I would recommend the course.","This course was incredibly interesting, and Professor Di Fabio is fantastic!"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Be prepared for a lot of work, but also a great deal of progress.","good class, but insist on organization and a set syllabus.","The course is really frustrating because of its lack of organization. I missed assignments not because i failed to do them but because i was unaware we had them. The course feels very haphazard and confused.","This is a great class if you put effort into it and get to know Professoressa Lolla. She is very helpful and willing to adapt the course to your needs. The course is not very structured so do not expect to  have a fixed schedule. Otherwise, it is fun, and great way to get a citation requirement or just get better at writing, reading, and speaking Italian."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This was an amazing course. Even if you don't like literature too much, the way professor di Fabio teaches is so great you are bound to find something in the material that interests you.","Italian 50 is tough, but very worth it. It gets you to a point where you really feel almost fluent and seriously improves your writing ability. Be warned though, it is a lot of work!","If you're willing to put in the work, this is a fun and enjoyable class that will greatly help to improve your Italian. The class size and the nature of the course, however, will require that you do all the work and are ready and willing to think and discuss at length. Professor di Fabio is a great teacher and a wonderful person, and she is willing to work with you at length.","This class provides a fun introduction to writing in Italian both creatively and academically. The class is very discussion based, so putting time into the readings (quite a few) is very necessary. The main text, Amata Scrittura is a very interesting exploration of the creative process, and many of the assignments (especially the translations) are very engaging. Also, Professoressa di Fabio is a lovely person."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This is a great course! It follows the 30, 40 series really well and focuses on your written Italian, which definitely needs improvement if you have not worked on it otherwise, as 30 and 40 do not hone in on writing skills. You definitely need to spend time reading and analyzing the texts, but definitely do so- it is worth your time!","Only take it if you're not only fluent in Italian but want to learn how to write academic Italian.","This is a fantastic class that really helps your Italian. You cover a great range of excellent Italian literature. But be prepared for time-consuming homework."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["Definitely take this class. Your Italian will improve so much! It's loaded with great opportunities. The faulty in this department are so kind and intelligent as well.","Italian 50 is a very rewarding course that will substantially improve your writing skills by the end of the semester. Dalila is organized, enthusiastic, and genuinely passionate about Italian literature and poetry, and her energy comes through during the lessons. The personalized feedback we received in a small class of three was fantastic, and I learned almost as much from reviewing my papers with Prof.ssa Colucci than our lively class discussions. After learning some of the basic technical aspects of Italian literary analysis, most of the class was spent on the thematic ideas of the literature and poetry we read, which I really enjoyed.","Take this course. Dalila is the best teacher I've had at Harvard. The material is absolutely intriguing. Even if you aren't a literature-oriented person, this course will introduce into the world of Italian poetry like no other."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["My favorite class this semester.","This class was truly transformative for my writing skills and I'd recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat!! When it comes time for compositions, always take your time and give this class as much attention as possible because you can get so so much out of it. Dalila is one of a kind--SO passionate and dedicated to this class! TAKE IT, ITS AWESOME!!","Dalila is fantastic. You'l learn a lot of italian in a more in-depth way, and you'll become a much better writer. It's not the best for becoming a better speaker, but you'll have some opportunity to speak. The texts are all interesting and applicable."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"4.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ITAL 50","course_id":"4422","cat_num":"127889","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ITAL 50","course_id":"4422","cat_num":"26649","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ITAL 50","course_id":"4422","cat_num":"127889","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
