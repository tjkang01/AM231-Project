'09":{"comments":["This tutorial is great if you're interested in gaining a deeper knowledge of ancient parody. You should enjoy research and be self-motivated. The day-to-day work is not that heavy, but the final paper requires substantial work outside the classroom.","this class will tell you if you want to write a thesis or not","The more you put into this course, the more you get out of it. Take this opportunity to really dig into the texts you're assigned and learn as much as you can from them, and from the reading\/writing process.","It's mandatory, but helpful for getting a feel for what the thesis process is like. Also, do good work on your presentations."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["This class provides a great introduction to archaeological methods and studies and a good specific knowledge base about the particular sites and topics covered.","I guess your experience for Classics 98 depends on two factors: topic and instructors. If you enjoy the topic, you will enjoy the class. As far as instructors go, Andrew and Rob were excellent, but I don't doubt that the other instructors are great as well.","If you're interested in ancient archaeology, it's about the most interesting you're going to get! :)","If you are either in this tutorial or have Rob & Andrew, your tutorial will be incredible.  As for the junior tutorial overall, I am very glad to have been involved with it.","Classics 98 is pretty easy","This class is great for exposing you to different schools of thought and criticism within Classical scholarship (you'll read a lot of interesting articles on various subjects) and you'll find out if you've really got a thesis in you when you're writing your final paper."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["This is a great course!!!  I recommend it with enthusiasm!!!","Lots of fun!","the best class i've taken at harvard so far.","The tutorial is a wonderful experience that will be beneficial in preparation for writing a thesis.","joke class: just write a termpaper, which you would normally do for other classes anyway. No midterms, no exam; just superficial powerpoint presentations each week.","Duncan is the best grad student teacher, and one of the best teachers all together that I have had at Harvard.  This class was thoughtfully put together, the work was pleasurable and fascinating, and I never expected to grow to love the material as much as I have."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["The work for this class is best tackled a little at a time; spending a few hours every day is much easier than trying to do research and prepare a presentation even a good 24 hours ahead of class.","You should like vessels. You will be talking about them a lot.","Fun, interesting, and rewarding.","Keep in mind that you are writing a substantial paper at the end of the course which factors into most of your grade, so always use your assignments to develop skills towards that goal."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["An interesting class that helped me examine a number of different ways of doing research and finding information.","Be prepared to put work into this course. It is sometimes taxing to present every week, but eventually you become used to it.\r\n\r\nStart the final paper early!","Although it involves serious dedication and commitment to weekly readings and research, the material is very engaging and covers a large time span stretching from Hesiod and extended through the second sophistic. You will have focused assistance and helpful constructive criticism with the very small class size. Your research, reading, analyzing and presenting skills will all improve and make you a more confident learner and student.","If you engage with the primary source material it is a very rewarding course, and you also learn a lot from your peers"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This class exceeded my expectations for a class on mythological art.  Analyzing and critically thinking about painting, murals, statues, poetry\/ekphrasis, sarcophagi, etc. is the most interesting way to learn more about, not only the myths, but also the ancient societies in which they arise.","This is surely the best of the classical tutorials on offer. Tom Keeline is a gentleman and a scholar, a classicist and teacher sans pareil. The material is extremely interesting and the readings are excellent and satisfyingly comprehensive - this course really covers the entirety of Latin and Greek literature in an arresting and understandable way.","Very rewarding.  Make time for it.","It is difficult but you will learn a lot, especially on how to give a presentation to a class."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This was a very enjoyable class. The readings were great and the weekly discourse was always interesting. Dan is a terrific section leader and a really great guy.","This was a fantastic class--Dan Bertoni was a great tutorial leader, and the subject material was fantastic."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["These classes vary greatly each year depending on the TFs in charge. That said, Roman and Greek law is a very interesting subject with a lot of interesting themes, so by all means take it if that's where your interests lie!","This is a great class! I knew nothing about Greek or Roman law going into this class, but that has certainly changed now. Just make sure to always have a presentation prepared and do the readings to make this class a good experience for yourself.","This course was somewhat pointless.  We learned a fair amount about ancient law, but as a course that is meant to help us prepare and think about our thesis, I didn't get much out of it."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["This course provides an excellent overview of health in the ancient world. It's also very helpful in getting you to think about potential thesis topics and in preparing you to write a longer paper.","Every Classics 98 tutorial is different, so if you do not plan on taking Classical Beginnings, feel free to skip this review.\r\n\r\nFirst off, this tutorial was everything that I hoped it would be. The discussions were satisfying and detailed, given that there are only five students in the class, the course material (as well as the emphasis on research methodology and difference schools of historical and philological thought) was interesting and it prepped me well for potentially writing a thesis, and ultimately, the grad students were committed to the course and were great discussion leaders.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I recommend this course with reservations is because the actual material is incredibly difficult - meta-literary theory is really hard to wrap your head around, and if you're not passionate about it or you're not willing to train yourself to think about both the text itself AND the author's relationship with that text, it will be a tough course.","This course is difficult if you don't have any exposure to ancient Greek language or culture.  If you are interesting in Greek, this will be very fun.","If your classical interests are of the more historical persuasion, this course is not for you. If you are interested in literary theory, this course is definitely for you!","This course is fantastic. PLEASE take it. The discussions were so thoughtful and engaging, adding to knowledge about the past as well as the creation of the medical field. If you have an interest in either Classics or medicine\/disease, this course is perfect for you.","This course was very enjoyable. The topic of Classical Beginnings was fascinating and the work load was manageable","Classics 98 is all about what TF you work with and what the subject you are studying is.  Katie is the absolute best TF to work with and any offering from her will challenge you and leave you very satisfied and enriched.  Do some investigation into who will be teaching your 98 as this really does have a huge effect on what your experience will be!","Ancient Medicine was a fantastic course!"]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This class was great, and Marco was a fantastic instructor. The Idea of Progress topic was very interesting, and I left the course with a deep understanding of the thread. Very discussion based in a small course setting (4 students), so make sure to do the readings.","This course really does depend on the Tf you get. Marco was an expert TF, who had a master command over the material, was quick on his feet responding to any inquiry, and always provided ample and helpful feedback. Make sure to start your paper early, though! 20 pages do not always write themselves."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Think carefully about which tutorial you take. It may be enjoyable to take one on a topic\/field that you already know well, although I got more out of the process by taking one on a topic and texts I hadn't dealt with previously. It's tempting to skip the readings since there are no exams, but (a) it's obvious when you haven't done the work, since there are only 2-3 other people in your class and (b) you'll surprise yourself with how useful some of the articles are for your final paper. It's very stressful but overall fine to write the paper in the last day or two, but make sure you actually have research done in advance. If you only give yourself 2 days to research the paper AND write it, you'll have a miserable and probably unhelpful experience."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"4.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CLASSIC 98","course_id":"4971","cat_num":"126109","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CLASSIC 98","course_id":"4971","cat_num":"31083","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"8","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CLASSIC 98","course_id":"4971","cat_num":"126109","1s":"0","2s":"8","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
