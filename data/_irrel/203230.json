It introduces students to three authors of diverse style.","Learning Greek is a lot of fun and will open up a lot of new areas of study. Greek 10 does a great job of letting you start working on original texts after intro Greek.","The course is an excellent transition from grammatical instruction to reading real texts; there's a good variety of relatively straightforward texts (they change each semester but I've heard similarly from prior students). Think of this course as a class with a moderate reading load when you sign up; it is not meant to be easy or hard, but it will be very difficult if you fall behind on the readings or skip them. The vocabulary is tough to memorize since most of it is unfamiliar, but you get used to it over time."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"7.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
