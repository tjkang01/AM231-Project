Even though the Balkans is an extremely complex region that's home to a variety of cultures, sometimes it's just brushed off as \"Europe's underbelly\" or a transitional space between the eastern and western worlds.  The course initially introduces these stereotypes and then, through the investigation of different regions\/cities in depth, quickly refutes them."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This is a great class if you are interested in studying BCS history through a certain narrow subject. The great part about the class is that it is really small and can adapt to any one person's interests within its format. Because of the size of the class, prof. Vidan is also able to really pay attention to every single person's class. I enjoyed choosing my prompts and writing shorter and longer papers that were really interesting rather than forced by the authority in the class. \r\n\r\nGreat discussion class and really enjoyable material. Keep in mind you will get out of this class as much as you put into it!","absolutely great class, definitely take it","Amazing course"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This course was fantastic. I previously had limited exposure to ex-Yugoslav writers, so I was unsure as to how difficult this class would be. Professor Vidan was able to ease us into the literature, and always structured the class to fit what we were most interested in. I was able to work on both my reading comprehension and writing skills throughout the semester, and would take the class again in a heartbeat.","This class is what you make it -- if your class is motivated and interesting and you push yourselves, you will get a lot out of it. Professor Vidan is a fantastic (and, to my mind, underused) resource.","If you want to improve your BCS skills, I highly recommend this class."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["A great class, self-led and a lot of it is up to how much work you want to put in. I took it twice with different topics and led tremendous amounts each time. Highly recommend it if the topic is of interest or if you are looking to get detailed feedback on your written assignments. Requires a great deal of being self-motivated to follow up on your work.","Very good teacher, fun if you have previous experience speaking BCS"]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["Excellent course, tailored to the topics that are interesting for the students. Very small so you'll get to know both the professor and the students very well. Aida is amazing.","An absolutely incredible instructor, Dr. Vidan will devote interesting and thought-provoking readings that enhance learning of the language. We were exposed to some of the most famous and respected authors, poets, and filmmakers while learning a language we hope to professionally employ in the near future. A must-take class at Harvard!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"4","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"BCS CR","course_id":"11139","cat_num":"110075","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"BCS Cr","course_id":"11139","cat_num":"18037","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"BCS CR","course_id":"11139","cat_num":"110075","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
