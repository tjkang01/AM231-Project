The teachers are great and generate a lot of enthusiasm about the subject.  The grading rewards hard work and a dedication to learning portuguese.  Some assignments are tedious, but that is the nature of all language classes.","TAKE PORTUGUESE!!! You will learn an amazingly fun language, and you'll never find a better teacher than Concei\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a3o.","It's awesome and there's no reason why you shouldn't take it.","Portuguese is fun and useful.","Take conceicao's section! Her lectures are fabulous, as is Portuguese at Harvard. I proselytize for this class almost every day as I've enjoyed it so greatly.","Portuguese is a fun language! Concei\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a3o is incredibly nice.","portuguese department cares a lot more about its students than the spanish department.","This class is fun, takes place in a relaxed environment, and you will definitely get to know your classmates well.  Conceicao is THE BEST.  This is a fairly easy class, and you will get out of it however much you are willing to put in.","Portuguese is a beautiful language, and is really hard to pick up. I think that instead of easing us into the course, it would be a lot more helpful if TFs actually tried to teach us how to be fluent in the language, instaed of teachin gus how to do well on the tests.","It was awesome.  I looked forward to class every day","Portuguese is a great balance to a difficult schedule but also really rewarding, if you put the work in. I loved having Conceicao in class and think I have a solid grounding in Portuguese."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["The teaching staff was amazing. The course was so fun. Normally when classes are really fun they sacrifice the learning; however, this class had a very healthy balance between work and play. Most of the time I couldn't tell the difference!","Take it. You'll understand why Harvard's language programmes are so highly-rated after a class like this.","Take this class! Heloisa is the best, and you'll learn a ton. Just make sure to do your work everyday!","Portuguese is a really fun language with a manageable workload! If you want a fun class where you learn a useful skill then you should take this class!","Portuguese is awesome, this course is awesome. Relaxed yet efficient learning experience with a good class size and you are able to make yourself understood in Portuguese after only one year.","Great fun","This class is a great opportunity to get a taste of such a beautiful language. By the end of the course, we cover all of the verb tenses. I just wish it were a more intense language course.","Fantastic course. The whole department rocks. The work load is relatively light, but make no mistake - you will learn a lot!","Portuguese is super fun and Luca is great! There isn't a lot (or any) organization in the class however--the syllabus is hardly ever followed, which can be frustrating at times, but I would still recommend taking the class, it is worth any frustration and was one of my favorite classes here! There is also a large emphasis on speaking and most of class is just that, which is great!","Expect this course to be serious, but rewarding work.","This class was a lot of fun and isn't a ton of work. It covers a lot of material and is definitely a comprehensive introduction to the language.","I would probably have learned more if I had stayed in my room and just read the textbook. This course needs to believe in itself and actually expect its students to work.","Luca was a super fun teacher with tons of enthusiasm that made class one of the highlights of the week. The language is already super interesting, but he made it even more exciting to learn."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This course is amazing and really has allowed to become conversational in Portuguese.","Max is a cool guy, and for someone who isn't into languages, I definitely think Portuguese is an awesome way to fill the requirement. Definitely more work than Aa, but still good!","Great course and plenty of travel opportunities to Brazil.","Portuguese is an amazing language and a language that is becoming more necessary to know, especially in regards to Brazil's growing position in the world. Especially if you know Spanish, Portuguese is a language that you should consider taking since it is the language tied to so many different cultures around the world, such as Brazil and Latin America, Portugal and Europe, Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique and Africa, and others. Portuguese helped increase my passion for languages immensely.","Amazing, fast-paced class. Overwhelming at times but you'll learn a lot.","It's such a fun class, but you learn a whole lot.","Make sure you have the right TF","This is a fun class with a relatively light workload.  Make sure that you make efforts to speak in Portuguese in class; it is one where you definitely get out what you put in."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["A lot of work, but you learn a lot!"]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This course is incredibly enriching. The cultural part of the course is particularly engaging, and I believe my language skills have improved greatly.","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.

The department is nice too because it is so small. My first semester, I only had six people in my class, and the second semester, I only had four people. This allows for a lot of interaction with the TF and other people in the class, and for a lot of the focus to be on you. There can be a lot of work, but it's necessary to learn the language. Great teaching staff as well!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.30","workload":"7.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.70","enrollment":"5","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PORTUG AB","course_id":"4442","cat_num":"127863","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PORTUG Ab","course_id":"4442","cat_num":"30145","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PORTUG AB","course_id":"4442","cat_num":"127863","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
