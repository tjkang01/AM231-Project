You will learn a lot about learning and teaching and you will get to do so in an incredibly intimate and supportive environment. The instructors are unbelievably dedicated to the course and to working with you to produce the best educational experience possible.","The class will be what you make of it. This can be great if you have an idea of what you are looking to learn from the course.","Take this course! It was fantastic, I learned a lot, and I had a great time. If you're in research, then issues of teaching and learning are relevant for you, even if your own research doesn't touch directly on this subject matter. After all, we're all students and teachers in some context."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 2550","course_id":"11465","cat_num":"26673","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 2550","course_id":"11465","cat_num":"26673","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 2550","course_id":"11465","cat_num":"26673","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
