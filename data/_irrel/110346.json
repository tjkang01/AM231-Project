You'll get to dig deeply into political theory and factual evidence, and you come out learning something concrete about the changing world you live in today.","Interesting readings that are also easy to talk about even if you just read the title. Yascha is a great teacher and provides honest and concrete feedback.","Since this was the first time teaching the class there were roadbumps early on.  The class improved by the end of the year, and I have hopes that this will be a good class in a few more semesters.  It is very lacking on any sources besides boring 20 page texts.  Yascha will help improve your writing but only take this class if you actually like the material.  I mean it is no sports and the law but it isn't nearly as bad as body in art","This is a great expository class for students who just want an interesting topic. Everyone in my class enjoyed the topic because it was very applicable to today. Writing about it was also fairly enjoyable because of the current debates that are occurring over digital democracy.","This course is probably one of the most painless Expos courses available, with little focus on readings and relatively fewer pages of reading overall.  However, it still requires a lot of work to get an A (as it does in all Expos courses).","interesting topic, bad preceptor. although the topic is pretty relevant and interesting, the preceptor (Yascha) is a grad student who is new to teaching expos and is still working on his own writing.","This class will teach you to approach democracy itself in a new manner, and its subject matter is fresh and relevant to current affairs.","This is an excellent class for intended Gov concentrators, there is a lot of overlap with Gov 20. It's great way to both fulfill your Expos requirement and take a Gov related course.","this class is extremely interesting because it is so relevant to our modern day. Not only do you get to read about other people's ideas when it comes to democracy in the digital age, but you ultimately use everything you learn to formulate your own proposal.","Great material covered--I really enjoyed writing about this topic."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["Everyone always talks about hating expos but this class was fantastic all around.","As far as expos classes go, it's interesting, especially if you're interested in government and policy.","TAKE THIS CLASS! Relatively low workload, straightforward essays, amazing teaching. You'll actually become a better writer and it's actually enjoyable. Yascha is the man and he makes this course #1.","I really think this is one of the best expos sections. You should definitely rank this one highly. The course readings were very interesting and Yascha was a really great preceptor. He was always very friendly, all of the assignments were very well planned out and built up to each essay. The readings were sometimes a little long but always reasonable. All of the essay comments were very helpful. You'll get a lot out of this class.","sometimes","Expos in general is a miserable experience. As advice for any expos course, if you can, start your essays early. You will regret not doing so. This class while it sounds like it's for tech involved people, is really only for government concentrators. The readings can be long and arduous but are quite interesting.","This is a great class for those interested in government or politics, and possibly for those interested in computer science, although there is an emphasis on political theory. Yascha is an excellent preceptor!","If you've got any interest in government, technology, or the intersection of the two, this is the Expos for you. Yascha is an absolutely fascinating instructor \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he's great on all things tech\/gov, and an excellent writing tutor! He'll really help you strengthen your writing style!","The topics are interesting, the preceptor is fantastic, and you develop your writing skills. What's not to like?"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"11.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"14","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.245","course_id":"11480","cat_num":"31391","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"9","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 20.245","course_id":"11480","cat_num":"31391","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"10","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.245","course_id":"11480","cat_num":"31391","1s":"0","2s":"13","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
