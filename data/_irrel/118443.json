However, it remained a little too \"big picture\" in how it could be applied to our everyday lives.","It will certainly shape the way in which you examine the way religion is deployed in modern political and social arguments."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Take this class if you are interested in religion and politics and current event. It provides a pretty good survey of the phenomena and the teaching staff is really great.","This class is an excellent, topical, and timely look at the intersection of government and religion in the United States. Its lectures are interesting and informative and its discussion component is very well managed and truly illuminating. The course integrates theory, historical context, and current events and debate well. Overall this is a great overview with an even better discussion component.","This class is the full \"Harvard Experience\"... open discussion about an interesting topic with brilliant students and a fun professor!"]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This class is not especially difficult, but you will definitely learn a lot about religion and politics, and the implications of what you learn cannot be overstated.","Amazing class--valuable for students of all backgrounds, whether in religion, history, government, sociology, etc. The class draws a diversity of students (from a variety of graduate schools and the college, and even from other area schools), and so it also draws a diversity of voices. This makes class discussion incredibly interesting. You begin to realize how important religion is to American politics, which may not always seem evident in this generally secular environment that is Harvard.","Professor Willard is incredible and the subject matter is very interesting. There are also some really impressive Div School students that we all learned a lot from. I definitely enjoyed this class.","Professor Willard is amazing and helps to create a super fun and engaging atmosphere on a very interesting topic","Professor Willard is very sweet and down-to-earth, and the topics covered in the course would be fascinating to anyone with an interest in American religious history, religion and politics, or liberal theory. When I took the class, there were some great guest lecturers whose careers dealt with the intersection of religion and public life, whether politics, community organizing, or interfaith work (Dr. Shaun Casey, director of the U.S. State Department's Office of Faith-Based Community Initiatives, was one such guest). There were some problems with course assignments\u00e2\u20ac\u201dperpetually broken links on the outdated website and deviations from the syllabus meant it was often unclear what we were supposed to be reading, or what we'd be assessed on for the midterm and final. But assuming that is fixed in a future iteration of the course, I'd recommend it.","Really great, broad, look at religion in american public life. I came into the course knowing nothing about religion, and came out of this course with a concrete understanding of religious discourse in our country. However, I wish we would have learned a bit more about different types of religions."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"9","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 1550","course_id":"5085","cat_num":"1431","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RELIGION 1550","course_id":"5085","cat_num":"1431","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 1550","course_id":"5085","cat_num":"1431","1s":"2","2s":"6","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
