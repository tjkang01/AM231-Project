beginner Korean language students to take their language skills to the next level"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["You should have a passion for learning Korean, not just doing it for language requirement."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Jung Heeyeong is an amazing professor. I love her so much! She is so kind and genuinely cares for her students. She honestly is the best professor. The class itself was really fun, too. Even though this class was at 10am, I looked forward to going to class everyday. Also, she teaches effectively--my writing and reading improved a ton. I HIGHLY recommend taking this class!!","That it is fun, especially if you study hard.","This class was my favorite class this year. Ms. Jung makes it so fun and interactive. I also made some fantastic friends this year in this class as it is quite small. We became a family this year.","This is by far the best class I have taken at Harvard. The class size is small and you get to know many other like-minded people. It's a fantastic way to learn Korean in an efficient and fun manner!","Really enjoyed the class.  The teacher is amazing and makes the class very enjoyable.  The work is not bad at all but I thought it was more difficult than the first semester.  You won't regret taking this class.","If you are deciding whether or not to take this class, TAKE THIS CLASS. JUST DO IT. This was honestly the most amazing class I've taken so far at Harvard. Professor Jung is absolutely amazing and at the end of the year the class ended up feeling like a family. Even though the class is at 10AM it was the thing I looked forward to every day! You get really close to both the teacher and to your fellow students, and you learn so much Korean during the class. I'm Korean American and my grandparents even noticed a difference in how much my Korean improved! All assignments, presentations, etc are reasonable and get a lot of feedback, which is very helpful. Individual sessions are like enjoyable conversations with the teacher and really helps to build the student-teacher relationship. You can tell that Prof. Jung really cares for her students: she brings us snacks, is receptive to our opinions and comments, and organizes things like Korean cooking day (yes, we cook and eat Korean food. Amazing, I know). I cannot emphasize how perfect this class is for anyone looking to learn Korean!! And if you're not looking to learn Korean, this class will change that too. BEST. CLASS. EVER. And the best part is if you're going to pursue Korean past the beginner's level you get to have Prof. Jung for level 130 too!","Take this class. Absolutely take this class."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["This is a class that focuses primarily on heritage speakers and people of similar background. While a thorough understanding of Korean is not necessary (as that is what you learn here!), it is important to be used to hearing and responding in Korean.","Amazing course! So much fun even though we had to get up early in the morning. SSN is so understanding and flexible with everyone's schedules and she is an amazing teacher!","The work is tedious but necessary.","Your happiness and progress in this course really depends on how much time you put in. Professor Jung is amazing and really works with you!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"4.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"KOREAN Bxb","course_id":"876","cat_num":"3031","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"KOREAN Bxb","course_id":"876","cat_num":"3031","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"KOREAN Bxb","course_id":"876","cat_num":"3031","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
