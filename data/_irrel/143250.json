The advantage of the class is that it's more interesting to listen to researchers actually discuss these topics than to read a text littered with scientific acronyms and data tables. The disadvantage of the class is that it's extremely frustrating to have to play along with the not stimulating and totally scripted assignments."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["This course will teach you to look at objects more carefully than ever before.","You will, most likely, never get this close to a work of art again."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["good way for art history students to learn more about the materials they study","The class is great in theory, and you would be working with wonderful, highly-skilled, and knowledgeable people.  The entire staff is very open to questions and concerns.  Yet, the class is also still developing its format and identity, and there are some hiccups.  Expectations for written assignments are unclear (especially with multiple graders), and being able to replicate information from lectures and powerpoints is more valued in your written assignments than critical or innovative thinking- that may just be the nature of the beast, however.","This course is a great and detailed introduction to the scientific analysis of museum artwork, appropriate for art historians and scientists alike."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 206","course_id":"2595","cat_num":"6180","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 206","course_id":"2595","cat_num":"6180","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 206","course_id":"2595","cat_num":"6180","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
