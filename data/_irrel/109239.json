However, it does not provide you much support in trying to pick a topic. You need to come in with an idea in order to  make progress. Also, you will have to turn in little things for milestones, but  you do not get much feedback about them. Also, the certain section you are does not matter at all. They all basically do the same thing.","If you are really passionate about writing a thesis, then take this course.","Do a lot of preparation for your thesis work during your junior year and if possible over the summer.","Writing a thesis is a great learning experience, but make sure you have a good adviser (which I am lucky to have) outside of 985 and start collecting data over the summer."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Start on your research early. Getting started in junior year is highly recommended.","Writing a thesis is a rewarding experience if you find an adviser with a vested interest in you and your subject. Do not seek out well known faculty if they do not have an interest in your project.","Unless you have a good topic and a helpful advisor, don't take this course.","These sections are not that helpful, but I think writing a thesis is a great experience to get to know the ec department better and to see your accomplishments in ec.","Write a thesis and take this seminar -- you'll be grateful for the time it helps you carve out of your schedule to get your work done.","Well, you have to take it to write a thesis, oh well."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["You need to take it to write a thesis.

He is well-acquainted with the process of writing a thesis. He was very helpful throughout the semester.","I learned a lot in a short amount of time. The Stata problem sets are horrible and you might as well just go to office hours rather than spend lots of hours spinning your wheels. Eventually you will come to appreciate stata but only after working through it yourself on your own thesis towards a goal. Also, definitely try to have a topic ready before the semester begins, it would make the process a lot easier.","Make sure you have an idea of what you would like to write about and make sure you're really excited about your thesis topic."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["If you are writing a thesis, the course is helpful.","Even if you're not an econ major, take this thesis class if you have a thesis related to econ.","Writing a thesis is a lot of work, but it is fun and rewarding.","Would not recommend writing a thesis until you heavily weigh the opportunity cost of your time. The tutorial does keep you accountable however since there are regular deadlines. Some tutorial advisors are more dedicated than others","Only do a thesis if you really want to do it.  Don't do it for honors.","Stas is extremely helpful in the thesis writing process. He challenges you to think about your topic from different angles and asks really good questions that get you thinking. The class is very time-consuming (because it's your thesis!) but the structure in place is a great way to keep you on track. And the presentations to the entire section is very helpful as well."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"6.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"10","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 985PA","course_id":"951","cat_num":"109239","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"6","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 985p","course_id":"951","cat_num":"26105","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 985PA","course_id":"951","cat_num":"109239","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
