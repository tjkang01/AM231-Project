It really helps you rethink about logics in your project. Would be really nice if this course was offered in the fall, and that first year grad students are more encouraged to take this course.","strongerly recommended","This is a harder skill than we give it credit for, and I think most people think because they can rip apart a paper, they can write a good one too. Other courses often attempt an experimental design section, but these are often cursory and doesn't give you the chance to see the themes that develop across all subject matters."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Useful in thinking of good experimental design.","This course is an opportunity to discuss the elements required or desired in a well-designed experiment, in a systematic and in-depth manner. I found some of the concepts discussed in class useful and applicable to my day-to-day experiments. I definitely recommend this course to broaden the intellectual toolkit required to become a good experimentalist.","This course really gets you thinking about your project and your motive behind day to day experiments. It definitely helps you rationalize what controls you need in an experiment and why they are important.","Probably the most useful course you could take as a scientist!","This course is either tailored to students pursuing translational research or selects for these students. Although equally important and applicable to discovery science (particularly discussions of model definition and revision), examples and in-class discussions may not be directly related to basic work. This is in no way a criticism of the course, just something to be aware of."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["This course will change the way you approach your experiments for the better. Not sure whether it is better to take ASAP or once you are independent in the lab.","dry material but necessary to learn","Experimental design is incredibly important in science, especially in the field of medical\/translational biological science given the degree and reasons for the wide variation that can be observed. Proper experimental design will help the experimentalist interpret results more accurately.","It may be worthwhile to wait to take this class after you have joined a thesis lab","Everyone should have to take this class! Your future experiments will thank you!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"13","response rate":"69.23","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CELLBIO 302QC","course_id":"3018","cat_num":"127479","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"7","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CELLBIO 302qc","course_id":"3018","cat_num":"91286","1s":"1","2s":"6","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CELLBIO 302QC","course_id":"3018","cat_num":"127479","1s":"7","2s":"6","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
