time for it because this class can b very time intensive. Also a lot of things in the class are left ot personal initiative, so you get out as much as you put in. That said, it is a fun way of increasing your knowledge in the language.","I love Italian. This course was INTENSE. I said it took me 7-10 hours a week, but this wasn't always the case. BUT it is a lot more work than the other Italian courses I have taken so far, which makes sense since it is an upper level course. I was just not expecting it and overloaded my semester schedule.\r\nThere was no final. We had to do a few low key presentations and then a major one at the Sackler. These were neat, but A LOT of work! I learned a lot, but I probably worked 6 hours alone on my presentation: writing, researching, memorizing, etc. Definitely take the course if you want to improve your Italian! And Adoyo is probably one of the most brilliant\/interesting people I have met!","This class is A LOT OF WORK. Seriously, A LOT OF WORK. I was always doing homework for this class; however, the teacher was engaging and I really did improve, especially in writing.","Italian 30 is great class to develop your Italian skills. The class is very much a piecemeal effort and different assignments will feel like whole new projects. As long as you put the effort, you will benefit greatly.","This is a great course and will definitely improve your language skill. It is definitely time consuming throughout the week.","This class is wonderful. You read Dante and learn how to look at Italian art, music and history creatively and thoughtfully.","If you want to progress in Italian, you will have to take this anyway, and it's not absolutely terrible, but it won't be your favorite class and their will be work with sometimes little reward. I was taking a different language class at the same time, so it made it hard to focus on learning Italian. Definitely only take one language class if you take this class, and do work outside of class, because class itself, may not be good enough."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Don't take this class. This class took more time than my tutorial, and our assignments were often busy work or simply did not contribute to my understanding of Italian. I have never had this terrible an experience in a language class, so I would highly recommend you skip to Italian 40 instead.","I felt that the instructor had a lot of influence on the atmosphere of the class; i would recommend only if necessary to take it.","Do take this class. While learning Italian, you will also interact with great works of art and learn quite a bit about yourself."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["The main plus of this class is the instructor, Marco Aresu. He is undeniably one of the best language instructors I've had in my 10 years of foreign languages. He is extremely smart and makes learning fun. In addition to learning Italian, you will learn about culture, art, and other things you are curious about - what's it like for an Italian to live in the States? what is the difference between the US and Italian election process? what are the regional stereotypes in Italy? How does education differ and what are the pros\/cons of each country's methods to educating? Who are influential writers in prose, poetry, etc.? In what periods were the modernist painters most influential? Why is this considered art? \r\n\r\nOverall, an amazing class to take if you really just want to experience learning from an Italian perspective: dive deep into the language and let curiosity guide the way.","This is a very fun course! You take fieldtrips to the Sackler museum during class-time and Marco is the best. You really get to deepen your \"feel\" for the language. It polishes your grammar and teaches you to discuss abstract concepts with ease. I can finally speak without having to worry about what verb tense to use.","This class was by far my favorite class of the semester!  Professor Aresu is one of the kindest people, and is incredibly approachable and helpful.  My Italian speaking proficiency definitely shot up, and I feel that I have a much better grasp of grammar as well.  I would definitely recommend this class!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["There is a lot of writing every week, but it is very helpful practice.","This is a fun elective. It was the class I enjoyed most, and you can do well without much effort. However, a little extra effort makes a big difference in how well you learn the language.","This is a good class to improve your Italian, especially your writing. After taking it, I am feeling prepared to study in Italy.","If a few aspects of the course are changed and improved, the course will be great for anyone ready to start using their knowledge of the language more often rather than being drilled on grammar.  But, be prepared for it to be harder than you think and frustrating.  The syllabus is subject to change, as is the grading style.  Be prepared.","This workload for this class is extremely high. Be warned.","In this class you're able to simply use the Italian language without the hassle of grammar or other time-intensive assignments. If you like speaking Italian, and if you want to become more competent in it, this is a perfect class for you!","Very helpful course. A lot of writing...will likely require you to put in more time than you think to complete assignments, but it'll be worth it."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Great Italian class, especially if you enjoy art history.","This class really helped my Italian. Great practice both in speaking and in writing. The museum visits are fun and interesting.","This class is great! Make sure you have a solid grammar background because there isn't much classical learning. It's a lot of speaking and writing and you are expected to know the basics. You will probably have a small class so be prepared to have very engaging lessons."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This was one of the most rewarding academic experiences I have ever had. The class is not high-stress, but despite this lack of stress, you learn and grow a lot by taking it. This way, it gets the best of both worlds: it is enjoyable and it is educational. I would absolutely recommend taking Italian 30.","Sarah is an amazing instructor and made this a fantastic class. The small class size allows for a lot of participation and speaking practice for every student, so you will definitely improve your Italian. The museum visits are fun, though they often feel a bit rushed, but the freedom of choice in the projects and assignments allows you to pick topics you want to study further, which makes them more enjoyable. The integration of media (films, commercials, excerpts from essays or novels) helps you learn from authentic Italian sources as well. It is a more time-consuming class than the introductory and intermediate Italian courses, but the assignments are readings, research, and essays instead of busywork, so it's worth it if you have the dedication. Be prepared to review grammar on your own, as class time is more focused on discussing art or cultural issues, or reading assignments. Definitely take this class, it will improve both your speaking and written Italian so much and is a lot of fun!","This course will surprise you very quickly, as its writing requirements are much tougher than in Italian C. However, you will also learn to deal with them quickly. Ultimately, by the end of the course, you will be very impressed with how much your ability to write, read, speak, and listen to Italian has improved.","Italian 30 is a wonderful course that really improves Italian writing and speaking skills.  The museum visits are quite fun and explore some very interesting themes.  Class discussions and writing assignments were likewise very interesting.  The mix of in-class writing, more in-depth post-museum papers, and weekly journal entries give a good amount of writing practice.  The workload is generally quite manageable.  Overall, Italian 30 is an enjoyable and effective course.","I am so sad that Sarah is leaving because she is one of the best teachers I've ever had, and I wish more students could be influenced and inspired by her like I was."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["It's great! If you like art, and Italian, and having fun discussions during class\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich should be everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthen this course is great.","This course is a great balance of grammar review, reading short pieces of literature, and creative activities. I really enjoyed the final project, which was to record an audioguide in Italian for several works of art in the Harvard Art Museums. The professor was also excellent."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["If you enjoy the language, take the class.","I really loved this course. Studying Italian through art is interesting, and I really enjoyed going to museums, cooking risotto, filming an ad, and having great class discussions.","SPEAK in section, it is the only way you will learn","This class is frustrating. You end up having a lot of conversations about art that are not based in any knowledge of art history. You have to go to museums that are far away and the assignments take too long, considering you're not learning anything.","My italian is definitely better but it takes a lot of work."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["This class is a good way to improve you Italian and learn more art terms. Additionally, since the class tends to be very small (when I took it, there were only 3 students), there is much specialization to the students' level and interests. Don't worry too much about having class every day as the homework is generally very well spread out."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["Take this class if you are interested in art or just want a forum to speak, read, and listen to Italian. Please take the course seriously and be prepared in regards to grammar so that the class can focus on the material at hand. If you have questions about grammar, TFs have office hours and emails over which they can be contacted quite easily.","I absolutely loved Italian C. Eloisa was a fantastic TF and made learning the language fun. The art museum was a great backdrop for learning the language and I learned a lot about art as well as Italian. We did a lot of fun activities like going for coffee and making pasta as a class to gain conversational experience as well."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["I would say that it is a very good class, especially for students that already are interested in Dante Alighieri. However, a new instructor will be teaching the course the next time it is offered, most likely."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"4","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ITAL 30","course_id":"4420","cat_num":"128266","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ITAL 30","course_id":"4420","cat_num":"44998","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ITAL 30","course_id":"4420","cat_num":"128266","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
