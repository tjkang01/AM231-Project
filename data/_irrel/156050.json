Designing an experiment and writing a grant proposal at the end of the semester was also more challenging than expected.","It's fascinating, it's challenging in a good way, but it will require effort and extra work on your part if you've only a basic foundation of neurobiology, so only take it if you're willing to put in the extra brainpower."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["This was a super chill seminar that taught close-reading of scientific papers, presentations, and grant proposal-writing. Abhi was very kind and encouraging, while still challenging us.","I really liked it, but it's a type of class\/teaching style that only works for some people. I would only recommend it to people who are naturally curious about synapses\/the brain - most of my learning and enjoyment came from being self-driven and motivated by a curiosity about the material. Without that curiosity driving me, I think I would have found the class frustrating since so much extra work had to be put in on my own time to understanding everything.","It is a great way to learn more about a topic you are interested in for the pure love of learning.","Ask for help when you think you might need it!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"2.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hfl","course_id":"12560","cat_num":"85872","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hfl","course_id":"12560","cat_num":"85872","1s":"2","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
