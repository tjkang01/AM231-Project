The class is built around discussion and I think that I learn best from this. Tons of interesting topics, asymmetric information, immigration, obamacare, etc. makes the class very relevant.","I loved this course, because I think I learned to see issues in a way that's not purely economical nor purely governmental, but both. If this is offered again by the same professor, you should definitely consider shopping and taking it.","N\/A since class will not be offered in future.","You may not learn a great deal of new things in this class concerning economics if you have already taking an intro to economics class. However, you will definitely build a more nuanced understanding of basic concepts (which felt valuable), learn a few new things, and really see how economic concepts connect to the real world. Seeing how economists and government officials weigh the economic costs and benefits of regulation was exciting for me and seemed useful as a student of economics.","This is not a Harvard class. It does not teach you to think so much as to memorize. Class time was haphazardly prepared. Professor Rasmusen used what one of the tutors in my house called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153FSM\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for Failed Socratic Method, in which he would call on students who he thought weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paying attention (who were normally bored and thus distracted) and asked them either very open or specific but unclear questions with one specific answer in mind. When they came back with a brilliant idea, he would dismiss it as incorrect, as it was not the one that he was thinking of. The material alone is all pretty much from Ec 10, and everyone had, I believe, taken a minimum of Ec 1010. \n\nThat said, his research is actually quite interesting, and he pleasant to talk to during office hours.","The topic itself is quite interesting and interdisciplinary, combining economics and public policy. However Professor Rasmusen, as a visiting professor, treated students in a juvenile fashion, failing to challenge us in class and not moving class discussions beyond the information in the textbook.","This does not necessary apply since it was taught by a visiting Professor, but one thing to keep in mind is that the class requires some understanding of intermediate micro economics. Overall, it is not a very demanding course and the professor was always interested in fostering debate.","This class won't be offered again because Prof. Rasmusen is a visiting professor, but: the class is based on really engaging and important topics, but we all kind of got lost in the middle of the class, partly due to unengaging and unfocused lectures and partly due to interjections of irrelevant material like quasi-concavity, etc. Prof. Rasmusen is full of good intentions, but could also be awkward in dealing with younger people."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.30","workload":"2.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.00","enrollment":"13","response rate":"69.23","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 1035","course_id":"12808","cat_num":"71705","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 1035","course_id":"12808","cat_num":"71705","1s":"4","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
