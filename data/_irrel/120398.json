Veteran move to take this class.","Great intro to an interesting and increasingly important language.","You need to be ready for a class taught almost entirely in Portuguese, which made it really difficult. I couldn't learn anything in class because I could never understand what was going on, so I had to use the book and homework to learn everything.","it is awesome, i would definitely recommend it.","As someone who wasn't that interested in Portuguese and just wanted to fill their language requirement, I ended up really enjoying this course and learning a lot. Classes are fun and discussion-based and the workload isn't that bad. I would really recommend this course to anyone at all interested in taking a language course.","This is a great and easy introduction to the language. If you dedicate time to it, you will learn a lot.","It's a great class for somebody who hasn't taken Portuguese before.","It is fun! Read the assigned textbook pages before class--it really helps! Get into a smaller class.","It's fun, it balances the rest of a typical Harvard workload well, and it's the only class of mine in which I felt our class was a real community. Homework is time-consuming (because it is an intro language, and putting in time is the best way to improve) but neither too difficult nor high-pressure. Request Conceicao as your TF!","I would tell students to study the first two chapters (preliminary and one)and know the vocabulary BEFORE the first day of class. This would help immensely. Then I would beat into their heads that it is VERY IMPORTANT to study the verbs EVERY NIGHT. The course builds more quickly than it seems at first.","Portuguese is so much fun!","Just have fun, but make sure you actually put some effort into learning the language","Take this!! Especially if you get Conceicao as your TF, she's really amazing, and the class is really very painless, just by doing the homework and making it to section you learn a lot. Oh, and start on the homework a bit earlier than it's due.","Take conceicao's section! It's a fun, interesting course - the only thing about it that's sub-optimal is that the \"Laboratory\" half of the workbook assignments will require you to download and listen to 60 .rm files, which are highly inconvenient to go through as they are of poor sound quality. Other than that, great course, thoroughly recommended.","Good class. Conceicao is an extremely nice and committed teacher.","This was my favorite class. It was fun, relaxing, and I was really able to get to know the other people in my section.  The workload is fair, the tests are more than fair, and if you have taken Spanish in the past you will be at a huge advantage."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This is a fun and enjoyable introductory language class. There are probably less demanding intro language classes available, though this one doesn't expect an unreasonable amount of work.","Great class. You sing fun songs, talk with your classmates, and learn a cool language. Max knows a lot of facts about life and culture in portuguese speaking countries. Portuguese is a great language to learn and NO previous experience is necessary. Take this class!!","Great course!","Great class! Portuguese is a great and fun language to learn.","best intro to portuguese","Make sure to keep on top of the assignments, as they can take longer then one would think. It's also helpful if you've looked at the first chapter before the first day of class. Tests are pretty fair in general, but do focus on verbs endings as those tend to come up a lot. If you've focused on something in class, it's a good bet that it is on the test. Pay attention to the syllabus, because sometimes the instructor won't remind you when there is an assignment coming up. Also, Max Seawright is a awesome instructor.","This is a really fun class that is both easy and rewarding! You do have to work, but all your work will result in you learning a super cool language!","If you have to take a language course, I suggest it because you'll learn a lot without having to do much.","Even though Portuguese Aa was not difficult grade-wise, learning a new language is always difficult. The effort you put into the class will determine how well you'll speak and understand Portuguese after a semester, not necessarily your grade. That said, you will enjoy class much more if you work hard!","great way to learn another language. great teacher and great culture","Fun great class, definitely take if you are interested in portuguese!","The class was enjoyable! I think there's some independent studying needed depending on how fluent you want to become in Portuguese.","Be prepared - this is not an easy course with little homework. You will need to set aside a considerable amount of time when taking it - or risk falling behind quickly.\r\nIt is, however, very rewarding if you do the work.","You'll enjoy the class. Max is a great TF and as long as you pay attention you'll be fine.","This is a relatively easy course, the textbook is thorough and entertaining.","This class was a really fun experience and the Portuguese language is a lot of fun to learn.","This course doesn't require much work and is a little slow-paced, but Max is the funniest TF around, so you'll have a great time.","You must be discipline about practicing\/learning the language on your own time, because the class schedule is fairly relaxed.","Great class to engage with the community and globalized world!","Portuguese is awesome. You'll catch on quickly if you understand Spanish language and grammar decently well, but even without it this should be a breeze. It also sounds so awesome when spoken.","I took this class with the intention of fulfilling my foreign language requirement, and it ended up being one of my favorite classes.  Portuguese is a really interesting but beautiful language, and Aa makes it fun to learn while keeping it lighthearted and relaxed.  I would be happy to recommend Portuguese to anyone.","Learning Portuguese was super enjoyable with Heloisa as the teaching fellow! Language learning can certainly be frustrating at times, but her constant reassurance made me want to keep trying even with lots of initial mistakes."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This class is amazing! Max makes it so fun and there isn't too much homework. It isn't incredibly difficult, but you learn a lot.","It was a great way to get yourself acquainted with Portuguese. You'll walk away feeling confident to begin conversing.","AMAZING CLASS! Try to get Max! I am so happy that I took and I am now considering a citation because you fall in love with the Portuguese language.","I am sorry that Luca is not your teacher. I loved this course!","Take if you need a senior elective","This course is fantastic. I already feel as though I can already converse in Portuguese. It's very interesting and useful.","It is a wonderful class and Luca was an outstanding and engaging and passionate teacher, but aspects of the curriculum that Luca could not really control were disorganized. It was also frustrating sometimes when I did not get grades back on major projects.","This is a great course! Interesting, not too much work, but you learn a lot","This course is completely different from any high school language course you've ever taken and I learned more in this than I did in two years in high school. However, to truly benefit from the class, you must be willing to speak the language or at least review the class material in the interim between Thursday and the following Monday.","The TF is great and the language is mad interesting and you'll benefit loads from it!!","Pretty fun\/easy\/unique was to kill your language requirement. Max is so chill and class was a good time. Pretty light workload, although some weeks we had a lot of work. Also, you definitely have to do a lot of independent studying if you was to have a good grasp of the material and feel knowledgable in class (this could also be just because I didn't know another language or Spanish so it didn't come as easily). Overall, for someone that hates languages, I enjoyed the class and am actually looking forward to next semester!","Be prepared to be challenged and pushed out of your comfort zone. There is tremendous emphasis on the development of conversational skills and an appreciation of Brazilian culture.","This class focuses on small group discussion, as well as one on one speech exercises. You will be speaking portuguese in no time.","Take this class and go to DRCLAS for trips to Brazil! Workload is very manageable and TFs just want you to learn the language. Small class size, individual attention, and you learn something new everyday."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["It's a great class and the teacher is excellent! The workload is not spaced out that evenly throughout the term, but it's not unmanageable, and for the most part is very fun.","As a student who had taken 6 years of Latin from middle to high school, I was at a slight disadvantage from the onset of this class. I originally shopped Spanish Aa and French Aa, but I found that the students in those classes had taken those respective languages for as long as I'd taken Latin, which is completely unfair and shouldn't be allowed. Portuguese, I figured, is a class not offered very often at the high school level, so the students in it would all be starting at the same point. That said, those students who had taken Spanish (which was 6 out of 8 people in my class) had a definite advantage over me. Still, it was a great class, and I'm definitely glad I took it.","This is an AMAZING class.  Ben\u00c3\u00a9 is wonderful, and you learn so much!  The tests are reasonable and infrequent, and the final project is lots of fun.","This was definitely one of my favorite classes. The Portuguese department is a great community that'll provide you with opportunities to travel to Brazil or a Thursday night workshop in samba dancing. This class was challenging but not stressful. The assignments aren't too difficult but you may get more than one each night. It seems like busywork but the continual practice keeps you from forgetting material. If you're serious about learning Portuguese it provides a great foundation in only a few months. I came in with zero knowledge of Portuguese but now I'm able to have simple conversations and I feel confident about traveling to Brazil this J-term.","This class is a great intro to Portuguese class. It's very accessible and allows you to learn a new language almost seamlessly."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Portuguese is an amazing language, and it has been an honor to learn! During shopping week, I enrolled in Spanish for about 2 days before switching to Portuguese. I hesitated becuase Spanish is a more common language and thus seemed to be more useful in the long run... But upon doing some research, I discovered that Portuguese is actually the 6th most spoken language in the world. That fact convinced me to take this language, but now I'm so glad I took Portuguese regardless of its stats. It has a beautiful sound, and we have been able to learn a bit about Brazilian culture, which is rich. As someone who struggled with picking a language, I would definitely encourage people to try this one!","It's disorganized and the course head has no clear understanding of how the course even works.","The TF for my class was absolutely amazing. She was able to make the coursework enjoyable and engaging, and I really loved the rigor of the class. It's a bit overwhelming at first, but it definitely pays off by the end of the semester. There is not too much work outside of class as long as you pay attention to class and glance through he textbook every now and then.","Take this class if Ben\u00c3\u00a9 is teaching it - it was a pleasure being in his section!","The course was delightful. My teacher was consistently excellent. The schedule works on the principle of \"little and often and occasionally a lot.\" The workload is manageable if you stick to that.","Taught in small classes which turned out to be nice, teachers are all nice and good.","Take it!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"2.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"14","response rate":"57.14","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PORTUG Aa","course_id":"4441","cat_num":"7130","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PORTUG Aa","course_id":"4441","cat_num":"7130","1s":"4","2s":"8","3s":"6","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PORTUG Aa","course_id":"4441","cat_num":"7130","1s":"3","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
