'07":{"comments":["Definitely take it.  It seems like it would be helpful, but it ends up being even better than you expect.  Great general advice, group work exercises, and interesting discussion","This is a very inspiring class containing several keys for success where hard work and strong problem solving skills are simply not enough","Best when used alongside personal idea generation\/brainstorming, i.e. for graduate (or undergraduate) research."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["The class provides interesting perspectives."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["More suitable for advanced undergraduates or graduates simply because material makes more sense\/more relevant after several years of study.","Take it if you're interested in the content, but be aware that you might not get a lot out of the class--it doesn't leave you with many clear takeaways.","very different class from others, i suggest you can try.","Little work and little reward."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["If you are an engineering student, be prepared that this is not a technical course and in fact students with a technical background will likely be in the minority.  However, the course provides a good look into science and technology outside of the realm of academia, and working in teams with non-science students is a valuable learning experience."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Solid class, actually covers innovation theory. More than a bit disorganized this semester, but bound to improve on that front. My main complaint was that a few assignments were video-based in a way that made content completely secondary to the process of making the video, which at times was hugely time consuming and very frustrating. But I really did learn a lot about innovation in this class, so I generally recommend it as long as you have the stomach for a few major bull assignments.","This course only requires a small time requirement, but even at that I'm not sure it's worth your time. If you genuinely want to learn about innovation, go pick up any of the thousand books on innovation and you'll learn more than you learn in these 16 weeks.\r\n\r\nIf you're just looking for something easy to take, I suppose this is it, but you will pay by spending at least a few nights editing videos (yes, you will make videos), filling in a month's worth of daily \"ideas\" in your idea book the day before it's due, and generally wondering what was wrong with you that led you to think taking this mind-numbing course was better than taking a real class with real learning involved. \r\n\r\nCome on. You're at Harvard. You can do better than this.","The course was really disorganized. The TFs for the most part didn't know what was going on. The assignments were not clearly explained at all.","Class is not challenging and guest lectures are truly what saves it.","This is a good class, though it is hard to really \"learn\" innovation. Be prepared to spend a lot of time making videos!","Some of the topics (especially initially) were interesting and the course seemed clear. However, soon the course became erratic in the way it was run. Assignment expectations and evaluations became random and unclear with the spam of emails received from the teaching staff. The innovation lecture assignment seemed to be the most useful since it required each of us to read a book on innovation, which seemed to have taught us more than the course itself. The TFs and Professors seemed clueless at times (mostly in the second half of the term), which is when the course went from promising to annoying.","This is really a innovative course. All the assignments are not traditional. If you like to think outside the box and are always curious about getting things done with new approach and learn new skills, this course would offer you a lot. But if you find you are comfortable with doing problem sets or taking exams and are bothered by the non-traditional assignments (like making videos, doing presentations, drawing proof maps...), this course would be a disaster. Besides. this course gives you a lot of reading and you have to write a reflection every other week. You also have to keep a daily journal to capture new ideas everyday throughout the whole semester."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Fairly easy class, work requirement is low, and consists mostly of weekly readings and reflections. You no longer have to make videos (unlike the previous year). The case studies, readings, and lectures are generally interesting, especially if you're interested in starting your own company, etc. Lectures rotate between a few professors and guest lecturers.","Do not take this class if you are not interesting in engineering or technology, or the entrepreneurial process."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["One of the best classes at Harvard."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["This class will challenge you to stretch academic muscles that other classes do not.
