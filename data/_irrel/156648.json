Rebecca is excellent for thesis writers and people serious about a single semester research paper. However, if you do not have a passion for what you are researching AND an advisor that supports you and pushes you at times, this course can get annoying or difficult.","Rebecca is really helpful and invested in your thesis work. This pushes you to stay on a strict timeline where you are making clear progress throughout the semester, which culminates in a 25-page paper at the end of the semester.","This course helps keep you on track for completing your thesis and not procrastinating","Write a thesis! This is one of the only times at Harvard where you will be able to do just as you please-- and the possibilities for that are many! Writing a thesis will get you in touch with a wonderful professor and also acquaint you to how your peers are doing. Extremely important exercise at Harvard.","This class is a fantastic thesis tutorial. I have been continually impressed with how relevant the work in this class has been for helping me to progress with my thesis and the support offered by Rebecca is incredible. I would highly recommend this class for Ec and AM\/Ec thesis writers- it will make the process so much more structured and painless.","Mandatory for Economics thesis writers, this course forces you to progress in your thesis research.","Fantastic way to write a thesis - the deadlines and support are invaluable."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Write a thesis! Take this class! Make sure Rebecca is your seminar leader!","This tutorial made the thesis process so much more managable."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"8.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 985QA","course_id":"12799","cat_num":"156648","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 985QA","course_id":"12799","cat_num":"156648","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
