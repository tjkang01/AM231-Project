Some basic military history knowledge is useful but certainly not necessary.","If you are interested AT ALL in American history or the American military today, you should take this class. Prof. Mesok is a great teacher, opinionated and interested in what she's teaching. The readings were painless, interesting, and applicable. We read approximately one whole book a week, so it was manageable, but not necessarily light. Anyway- a great class, definitely my favorite of the semester.","international students will have to know that they will have a hard time on the essays due to the attention to grammar, the professor however, is willing to help if you seek it.","Great class.  There is a lot of reading, but you will want to do all of the reading because it is so interesting.  Highly recommend.","It's not actually about history."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"3.60","enrollment":"10","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1981","course_id":"10940","cat_num":"40644","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1981","course_id":"10940","cat_num":"40644","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1981","course_id":"10940","cat_num":"40644","1s":"3","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
