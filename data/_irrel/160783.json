If you are writing a theory thesis and he is still teaching, choose him! Overall for 985 courses, pick based on the person who is teaching, not based on the topic the ec department assigns to it. These \"topics\" are often arbitrary and many people's thesis deviate from this. Use your 985 advisor for day to day structure, advice about how to navigate relationships with professors, and small-scale reading of thesis.","Jonathan was great.
