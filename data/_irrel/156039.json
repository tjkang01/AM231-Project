If you have ever studied historical or present day conflicts and want to gain a deeper understanding to the causes and solutions to those current events, this class is perfect for that.","If you aim to better understand conflict theory, the readings in this course will undoubtedly propel you toward achieving that goal. However, don't expect to enjoy section-- your peers may take pride in 'getting away with' doing little to no prep work beforehand. Furthermore, this course does need to improve with regard to feedback given on assignments and expectations outlined for assignments prior the due date. It's a little unstable at the moment, and I have no idea what my grade will be despite hours spent trying to improve my work based on prior feedback. It's incredibly unpredictable.","If you're interested in conflicts and their (potential or possible) resolutions at all, whether they be in the U.S. or abroad, you should definitely take this class! It's very well-structured and takes you through several important theories in this area of study that are fascinating to apply to different real-world scenarios. I liked that it was an effective combination of theory and application. The readings can be quite intensive, but they are super interesting and doable if you set aside time to do them. You are given quite a significant amount of flexibility when it comes to writing assignments, and Mariska is great at providing feedback and support, and to just serve as a sounding board to bounce ideas off of.","Great class! I learned a lot and the work was extremely manageable."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["If you are at all interested in conflict (how conflicts begin, how conflict is perpetuated, why peace is so difficult to achieve, what steps we can take to foster good will), you will not be disappointed with this course. The group-based discussions were approachable and well designed. None of the readings were ever removed from the larger social context, which made it easy to understand why the concepts learned actually mattered. This is definitely one of my favorite courses at Harvard.","This is maybe the best class I have taken at Harvard. As a psych concentrator, this class has helped me become passionate about my concentration. The material is very relevant to every part of our lives, and Mariska does a great job at tying the material into current events. She cares very much about this class and her students and is always making herself available to talk about assignments. I see myself looking at the social issues around me through a different lens thanks to this class. This class helps you learn that there are names for the intergoup dynamics we see around us every day and in the world. Take this class even if you are not a psych concentrator.","Take this class. Not only is it interesting, Professor Kappmeier wants you to do well. She will meet with you, encourage you, and guide you through the class.","Not too much work, and interesting. If you are interested in the subject, I would recommend taking this course.","Mariska is great -- she provides a great forum to talk about important questions that relate to modern day, and the psychology background to have those discussions in an informed manner. Weekly questions ensure you read, but do not make the course a stressful one. Overall, very happy I took the course. Great community, low-key environment, and interesting topic.","If you're interested in intergroup conflict, definitely take this class! It's is SO relevant on a global scale right now, when it seems like every other day some sort of domestic or international conflict is erupting. People get pretty involved in the discussions, and most of the people that take this class actually really care about the subject matter and want to have real discussions about it which is pretty special. Prof. Kappmeier is also amazing! She is so enthusiastic and funny. She gives really helpful feedback and facilitates conversations in class in a very flexible way that is aimed at actually making sure people are engaged.","This class was hands down one of my favorite classes I've taken in my 3.5 years at Harvard. I'm fascinated by intergroup relations, specifically dealing with race and socioeconomic status, and this class takes you beyond the surface level psych of stereotypes and prejudice into the deeper themes of victimization and social identity. I loved it and would 100% recommend it to everyone. The workload is fairly light, weekly comments on course readings with the course readings usually being 3 psych papers, 2 5-page response papers, and an 8 - 10 page final paper. Definitely a breeze and fun to work in. Discussions were usually lively and Mariska does a great job breaking the concepts down."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"4.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"15","response rate":"86.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 980H","course_id":"12584","cat_num":"156039","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 980H","course_id":"12584","cat_num":"156039","1s":"1","2s":"6","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
