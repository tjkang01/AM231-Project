I never used Maya before this class but am currently at a level where I feel comfortable modeling and animating anything I need. While this class teaches \"molecular\" Maya, I used the skills I learned for \"hollywood\" Maya. It's a wonderful course taught by Gael McGill who is a wonderful professor and is VERY enthusiastic about Maya.","you don't get that much time to practice the skills in class. it would be nice if we could do tutorials more in class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.25","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"3.50","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"BCMP 302qc","course_id":"2952","cat_num":"45965","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"BCMP 302qc","course_id":"2952","cat_num":"45965","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"BCMP 302qc","course_id":"2952","cat_num":"45965","1s":"2","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
