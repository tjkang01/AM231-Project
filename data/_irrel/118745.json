Religion is incredibly supportive and the strict first-semester deadlines may hurt at the time but they will make your life better in the long run!","You receive a huge amount of support from the department.  Again, just make sure that you can handle the process."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["I loved writing a thesis.  It was a great opportunity to engage deeply with difficult material, and to form a new kind of relationship with a faculty member.

If you budget your time well and have a topic you care about this experience feels really rewarding.  I can't believe I'm writing this but it's true.","Writing a thesis in religion is a great life experience. The program is highly supportive of interdisciplinary and independent research, and provides guidance and peer interaction to a degree virtually no other program at the College does. It is hard. But not because of the Committee. They make it a far more pleasant process than it would be otherwise.","You get out of it what you put into it.
