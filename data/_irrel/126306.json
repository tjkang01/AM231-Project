Regardless, the instructor is very nice and shares a lot of cultural insight.","The Haitian language is very interesting and dynamic, as is the culture and history of Haiti.","If you already understand enough Haitian Creole to read and understand it, I would definitely recommend this class because I learned so many interesting things I never knew about Haiti.","Take if even remotely interested in Haiti."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Haitian Creole is a beautiful language and Patrick Sylvain is a fun and dynamic instructor. If you're interested in learning more about Haiti for any number of reasons, you'd be hard-pressed to find such an engaging introduction to the language elsewhere!","You will never regret taking a class with Patrick Sylvain.  If you put in effort and display a genuine desire to learn Kreyol, this class will allow you to refine your understanding of the language, learn about the underlying grammatical structures, and give you a close look at the etymology of words. Patrick is immensely knowledgeable about Haitian and Caribbean history, so use him as a resource to learn about Haitian culture through the language.  This class is very flexible, and many types of learning are accommodated (audiovisual, speaking, reading).  Patrick cares about good teaching and about his students, and he is a warm, kind-hearted person.  This course is a refreshing change from the more austere Romance Language department (coughFRENCHcough).","If you really like small discussion-based classes, and Haitian Creole\/Haiti, of course, you should definitely check this course out.  Patrick is really cool.","Know what you want and be engaged. Structure is loose so you have to have a plan for what YOU want to learn going in.","This is a class where you not only learn the language, you also learn the history and the culture.","It is a great introduction to Haitian Creole but is not as structured of a class as other language courses at Harvard."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Patrick is great, be sure to spend time practicing outside of class & not just studying the language","Patrick is one of the best teachers I have had here. He is warm, engaging, and conscientious. I always look forward going to his class. Learning haitian creole seemed a bit daunting at the start of the semester, but within days of starting the class I felt comfortable with the language and eager to learn more.","This class is awesome. Patrick Sylvain will teach you Haitian Creole effortlessly. Discussion and class participation plays a large part in this class, but it does not feel forced and contrived like in many other classes at Harvard. Definitely take this class. You'll learn a lot more than just Haitian Creole.","Patrick is an excellent Haitian teacher. You'll learn about the language and the culture, from day 1. Very highly recommended!","Haitian Croele is a Great class and Patrick is great. However, if you have never spoken french before or have never been exposed to Creole you need to put in a lot of work on your own. SUch as going over basic vocab like numbers, days of the week, the alphabet, etc. because they won't be taught to to you in class.","This is an awesome class. Not a ton of work, but enough to get the hang of the language. It's only introductory, so don't expect to be fluent after one term. Having a background in french was definitely helpful. Patrick also is very knowledgable about the political and social climate of Haiti. One of my most valuable take-aways was learning a little bit about how life is in Haiti.","Definitely take this course if you have any interest in Haiti, not just the Creole language.  You will learn a great deal and it's fun!","Have some idea of what you're getting into. I had never heard the language before, so catching up to others that had was a little more difficult. However, Patrick was more than accommodating to my pace and made sure I had an understanding before he moved on. Just quite a bit that we were expected to have a solid grasp on."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["If you're interested in Haiti, definitely take this course. Not only will you learn the language, but you will probably learn more about the country than any other course offered at Harvard.","Great class overall - not so demanding, yet You actually get to learn a lot and after one semester You are able to sustain basic conversations; You also learn a lot about Haiti and the context of the evolution of the language; Patrick is really energetic and passionate; and You also get to go to a Haitian restaurant at the end of the course!","THis course is fun. Plus you learn alot about Haiti and Creole.","Patrick is a very engaging and accessible instructor and fully integrates Haitian history and culture into his lessons. If you have the slightest interest in Haiti, don't pass up this great opportunity!","Patrick Sylvain is an extremely gifted teacher. Time flies by in the classroom because of the interactive nature of the course and you will learn a lot from your classmates too. I would highly recommend this class to anyone with an interest in Haitian Creole.","Be prepared to adjust to Haitian time, which is a good 10 minutes later than Harvard time!","This class is a hidden gem at Harvard. It is minimal work, but you'll come away with the skills to be able to communicate in Haitian. I plan on going to Haiti this summer, and I am confident that I'll be able to communicate to the residents of Haiti.","Taking Haitian with Patrick has been one of the great experiences of my time at Harvard. The class suffered from diminished meeting time this semester, but I have never picked up a language as quickly and enjoyed it so much as this. Patrick's lessons on contemporary and historical Haitian culture are extremely valuable for providing context for the language."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Taking Haitian Creole has been the best decision I have made at Harvard. Lesly, like Patrick before him, is an extremely gracious instructor with an easy-going personality and a knack for making you feel comfortable in the classroom. Before taking Haitian here, I had no prior experience with the language or culture but now feel as though I have learned an immense amount about both.","This class was a little disorganized.

You really learn Haitian Creole quite quickly, but keeping up isn't ever a problem. Lesly is an amazing teacher who emphasizes listening and speaking from the very beginning, correcting mistakes over the course of the class in both a lenient and encouraging manner. This is a HUGE help to learning the language. The class is a bit disorganized and assignments are sometimes late to come, but this isn't usually a major source of stress.

Lesly is really sweet and will really work with you sometimes but sometimes his expectations are a little high for first semester beginners.","It's great! If you have French exposure or background, the course becomes much easier, if not,  studying becomes a little more complicated.","Haitian Creole is truly a hidden gem for Harvard students! The course itself is very easy, very laid back, and also informative about the history of Haiti and the United States. Haitian Creole is also immensely useful in and around Boston (including our own dining halls), since many Haitians work in the area. I would recommend taking it for anyone!!","Be eager\/enthusiastic to learn."]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["Lesly is a really understanding and supportive instructor--he wants you to succeed and will provide you with the necessary support to do so.
