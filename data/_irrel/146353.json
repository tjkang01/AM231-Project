immunology.","I thought this class was extremely helpful, especially being a non-immunologist interested in host pathogen interactions. There was very little pressure and the emphasis really was on learning concepts and understanding the basics.","This course is vital to build a strong understanding of innate immunology. It covers information in depth that the other immunology courses fail to cover.","If you don't take this course, you will be a bad immunologist in the future...","I think it was a great introduction into innate immunity.  It was a well organized course, and I hope more classes like this will be developed in the future.","It's a great course, the professors are engaging, and they encourage a lot of participation."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["great course to review innate immunology concepts and to learn more details than were just presented in first year (G1) immunology course.","A great quarter course for a topic that does not get enough detailed in the Immunology core curriculum.  Lecturers, especially Alan and Jon do a great job tying lectures into the bigger picture, both from an organism\/cellular standpoint as well as an evolutionary\/philosophical standpoint.","I think this course provided a great foundation to innate immunology, which is not often covered in great detail, but clearly an important subject matter."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["If you want to learn about innate immunity in a laid back environment, this is the class to take: very informative and enjoyable!"]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["This is a great survey of innate immunology, from inception to current status in a great set of lectures.","This class provide deeper knowledge in innate immunity","If you are interested in having a deeper understanding of molecular aspect of innate immunity, this is the course for you."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This course gives a good overview of the different arms of the innate immune system. No outside work or required reading material. The lectures are presented by experts in the field for each topic.
