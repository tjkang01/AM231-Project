It's also a great way to experience what it might be like to write a thesis.","You have to take it.","Writing a 25 pg paper is a pain in the butt, but it's a good thing to do if you're thinking about writing a thesis.","This course introduced me to how exciting research could be, and made me more confident that I could write a 30 page paper and truly contribute a new piece of research to the field.","If you are a history of science concentrator thinking about writing a thesis, this class will help you to understand what that would entail.

I hope no one takes it as an elective.","Getting to write your own paper is really fun and exciting, but the section\/lecture component isn't very useful.","This class was the most rewarding academic experience of my college career. Writing a 30 page paper was a challenging but exciting endeavor, and it taught me a lot about myself as a student and my interests.\r\n\r\nI would tell future students to start researching\/reading as early as possible. Your topic will probably change over the course of the semester, but it's only by reading more and more that you'll get a better sense of what, exactly, you're trying to say.","This class is great- but make sure you write about something you really enjoy, something you would want to learn about for fun.","In this class you have an opportunity to write a very cool research paper.  Most people in your section will approach the junior paper with realistic goals, while some will suddenly think they are top scholars in their field.  This is incredibly annoying.","This course will succeed in its intent to prepare you to write a thesis.

In order to be successful you have to stay on top of assignments.

Honestly, the course is manageable if you start early as difficult as that is...","start writing your paper earlier than expected or else the end will be rough","Keep on top of the paper writing process - it's easy to get caught up in the research and forget that, at some point, you have to stop reading and start writing.  Set deadlines for yourself outside of what the course requires in order to get everything done in the least stressful manner.","This is a necessary and helpful HistSci requirement. It definitely helps to come to the course with a few areas of interest, topics you want to explore. The course is super useful if you want to do a thesis, but even if you don't it is great to take a crack at serious long-term research. The TFs are great! Make sure you start researching and writing early otherwise it'll bite you in the butt.","It is never too early to start revising and writing the paper. Even if you don't think you have all your sources yet.","A great class for learning how to write in the history of science. Having the freedom to choose your own topic really makes this class quite enjoyable.","As a necessary course for Hist of Sci concentrators, it's a good introduction to writing a substantial piece of research, and is a taste of what will be expected of you for writing a thesis.  The course itself provides a great opportunity for you to find out what your academic interests are, so it can definitely help point you in the right direction for a thesis.  A few suggestions: try and decide upon a topic and start collecting research on it early. The course only gives you about 3 weeks to write a 25 page paper, so it's important you get as much done beforehand as possible. For a lot of us, 3 weeks was simply not enough time.  Also, the work load was very substantial, especially the second half of the semester.","Get ready for real life research and a lot of work, this ain't easy.","This course was definitely a good experience because we had the freedom to do our own research and writing on a topic that really interested us. I felt that the course itself could've been structured better because at the beginning there was basically no work and then suddenly you need to write a 25 page research paper. The section component of the course also wasn't really useful\/helpful most of the time and it seemed like the time could've been spent better doing more productive things.","Really good for concentrators, especially if you want to write a thesis","The class is a great introduction to writing a research paper of this length that makes writing a thesis seem more manageable.","You are given a lot of freedom in this course - you basically come up with some topic in the history of science and go with it. It's neat coming out of it with a great paper, especially since it's a long one. They do a good job accompanying you throughout the process.","One of the best parts of the course are the relatively frequent individual meetings you have with your TF.","Get Jenna as your TF!  And pick a topic that you truly find interesting.","Be Wary.  Although this class is great, and you get to spend a whole semester researching your own topic, this class takes up more time than you would expect.","Great class. Prepares you well. Teaches you how to write really well. The feedback is great, and the support from your TF is great. It is a significant amount of time\/effort compared to other classes I've taken.","Great preparation for writing a senior thesis!","This class will help you to determine whether or not you should be writing a thesis.","It is hard work, but you will feel proud of the product you come out with at the end.","The task of a 25 page paper is very daunting, however you realize that the process of researching and writing the paper is not nearly as terrible as you think. The teaching staff is also very helpful and resourceful","Don't let the first few weeks fool you! The last few are intense!","It's a lot of hard work, but worth it in the end. :)","You have to take this course if you are a history of science concentrator, so the only thing that can really be done to make it as painless as possible is to spread out your work and make sure that you leave yourself as much time to write as possible.  The way that the course spreads everything out for you leaves far too much time open for searching for your topic and researching (without giving any real advice as to how to do that most efficiently) and not nearly enough time for the actual writing of the paper.","Junior tutorial is wonderful - I grew so much as a scholar and wholeheartedly recommend this course.","This class was a really challenging but great experience.  Working in groups and one on one with your TF is a great way to navigate the process of writing a long research paper in a supportive environment - I felt like I had a lot of great resources and peers to talk to throughout, and I hear all the TFs are great.  My TF, Jenna, was especially awesome and super helpful the whole time.  It was a great experience to do my own research in archives and libraries I didn't realize were available to us before this semester (this course helps you learn a lot about campus research options), and put together a piece of original scholarship.  The section meetings are also pretty chill and very fun - you get to be friends with the people in your section, who you peer edit with and go through this whole process with.  You'll definitely have to put in a lot of hours, but this is kind of a bonding experience with your concentration and in my experience, a really rewarding one!"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This course was great in order to learn \"how to write\" a History of Science research paper of substantial length and important in exploring potential senior thesis topics.

The process is spread out over the course of the semester and you receive great feedback throughout.","This class takes a lot of hard work and dedication. Don't let it intimidate you--but be ready for a challenge. Writing a paper of this magnitude takes good preparation and organization, and this course definitely helps you develop the skills necessary to write an exciting junior paper.","This course is a great introduction to research and producing a piece of academic work that is eloquent and that you can be really proud of.","This class has been revamped from previous versions, but unfortunately is still far from perfect. There are many small assignments, nearly one per week, that do a great job of keeping you on track with your paper. Yet I found that these detracted from the ultimate goal and pushed me along in an unproductive manner: I spent many hours writing and researching for things that I was not confident I would pursue. Additionally, the course lacks the individual focus of other concentrations. Sections are not small enough (~7 people) and the faculty and TFs are not lined up with your specific interests, leaving it to the student to discover nearly everything about their topic and making it supremely difficult to understand the previous literature and current arguments.","Research something you are really interested in! It makes the whole process much easier","Doesn't matter what I say; you have to take it. But it can be fun if you find something that is intriguing!","Lectures are completely unhelpful - be prepared to be extremely bored for an hour and a half every week. I was extremely disappointed in them and really didn't learn much in them. Also, they try to scare you by telling you to do 10+ hours of research a week... that is simply not feasible or necessary.","You'll get a good product, but sometimes the plenary and assignments will be a grind.","take research seriously from the get go","The section leaders are amazing! You get a really nice piece of writing out of it and get to know a lot about  your area of study (like a mini-thesis).","It's awesome. It's a fair amount of work, and you really can't slack off. But once again- it's awesome. And you have to take it. Enjoy it.","Junior tutorial is pretty hard. You pretty much have an assignment every week (although this made writing the final paper a lot a lot easier) as well as a lot of time spent in plenary\/section. Don't take this class too lightly","This course offers students a terrific opportunity to delve into a topic they find interesting throughout the semester, with excellent support from responsive professors and teaching fellows. Begin early, and approach this paper as your own piece of investigative work. It will be worthwhile.","If you're a HistSci concentrator you have to take this course. The lectures are awful and not even worth going to, but the section is helpful, although an hour too long. The good thing about the course is that it is structured so you can't start the paper too late. That's the best thing I can say about it. It wasn't stressful writing a junior paper that was 7000 words long. That's good course structure.","Think of a topic early and try to build it around the primary source material Harvard owns--this will make your research experience much more fulfilling.  Write often; it really does help because you are already familiar with the terms and style you'll want in the final paper, and have chunks you could  use directly in the paper.","This tutorial is extremely well-structured, and despite the daunting task of producing a 25-page research paper, was a consistently enjoyable experience. Though it is a concentration requirement, it is nothing to be afraid of, and was ultimately just as successful as the newly updated Sophomore Tutorial. The concentration is just getting better and better.","Plenary is completely unhelpful, but if you luck out with your section TF, you can have a great experience and produce some meaningful work at the end.","Get excited to dig into something scientific that you're really, sincerely curious about...","Start writing your paper as earlier as possible.","I liked the idea of working toward one final product, and learning new techniques for doing so.","This course was a fun experiment in getting to conduct your own research project, but the plenary sessions were a bit tedious at times. Make sure you stay on top of your assignments, and don't complete them just for completion's sake. Give yourself time to really think about the assignment each week, and try to make all of them build together- your post-thanksgiving will be much more enjoyable if you do!","This course is fairly easy, but I would spend the summer thinking very carefully and doing some preliminary reading on your topic. The more you know about what you might want to write before the semester starts, the easier the  process of writing the paper will be.","Selecting your own topic and writing a massive research paper is an excellent endeavor. I felt really accomplished at the end of the term, and I can't overestimate how important that feeling is. The plenary sessions were a bit tedious, but you can sort of ignore that and focus on doing work as an amateur scholar in history of science, which is far more important.","I love history of science and really enjoyed my junior tutorial and paper, so I would highly recommend history of science as a concentration and this class in particular to other students.","I was probably the only student who took this class as an elective (I was a joint concentrator and this was my secondary), and I think that it was quite the decision. This class is a lot of work and a constant source of stress, but at the same time, I have learned so much about research and producing a long piece of work. Turning in almost 40 pages of writing is really quite a feat, and you'll feel really proud of yourself at the end of it and ready to handle a thesis or another big project. That being said, in terms of taking it as an elective, don't do it unless you understand exactly why. I didn't have as much time as I should have to put into it, but I took it to become a better writer and that I did.","Make sure to plan ahead and think of topics during the summer\/semester before your tutorial, because it's useful to narrow down on a topic relatively quickly! Overall, a great intro into research-based history of science writing."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This course is obviously not optional if you are a hist of sci concentrator, but Meg is GREAT and super helpful with the junior paper!"]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["You get out what you put into this course.","This is a very challenging course but you will learn a lot about how to conduct independent research in the history of science and take on a large writing assignment.  The deadlines set by the section leaders are incredibly helpful!","This is a required class, so take it if you have to. Writing the paper was a more strenuous experience than I expected it to be, but they help you through it pretty well.","This course is a great next step in the history of science tutorial sequence. It provides a solid introduction to archival research and secondary source usage. My tutorial head, Anouska, was wonderful and accessible and provided wonderful guidance throughout the process. It is not an easy course and it requires a significant amount of time, but the support structure is there to help you through it.","History of science has been everything that everyone has said it is going to be. I think that this course did exactly what it was supposed to do. Got me thinking and intrigued in something outside of predetermined and preplanned course material from a textbook or lectures and I went searching and I had to stop myself from reading more and more. I learned so much and I enjoyed becoming an expert on something new and stepping outside of my comfort zone. I learned how to research and how to write a research paper. I also learned that I did not want to write a thesis, which was a valuable lesson that I would not have learned any other way!","This class is essentially just writing your junior paper (good and bad).","Don't go in with high hopes of improving your writing or being supported.","do everything earlier than you think you need to!","The research process is difficult but don't lose hope! Try to figure out your topic as soon as possible and see if there are primary sources available. I had to change my topic due to constraints of available sources - try to figure this out as early as possible.","It's required! But I enjoyed the class a lot and thought it was quite enjoyable. Plenary sessions were a little broad, though, and didn't seem too directly relevant a lot of the time.","The course assignments are structured in such a way that it makes writing a 25 page paper less stressful. You won't be able to procrastinate, because you get started right away. But I do think the plenary component was not super beneficial, since they tended to be broad discussions that may or may not be relevant to your specific paper. Sections were nice because they facilitated close interaction with other students and your TF. Overall though, it was really cool to write a 25 page paper on a topic of your choice. Huge sense of accomplishment!","This course is not easy but it's a requirement in the history of science department and you learn a lot by taking it. It also really helps you determine whether or not you want to write a thesis.","Great class to learn about original research. There isn't much to talk about because if you are taking this class you are doing so because you have to. It really depends on how competent your TF is. Mine sadly did not help a whole lot","The guidelines for writing the research paper are useful (though adding in your own mini-deadlines is a must), and the theoretical grounding plenary provides is helpful, especially if you are thinking about writing a thesis. If possible, try to get this class's schedule early so you can build your other commitments around these deadlines; research takes more time than you think.  Really useful training in scholarly history projects!","I loved the process of doing original research, and I had a fantastic TF who really helped me with the writing process, so I loved this course. If you don't like doing this kind of historical research, or if you had a less helpful TF, or both, I imagine that this course would be a real drag.","This class teaches you how to really write a research paper. At the beginning it seems overwhelming but it is a very gratifying process especially when you produce your final product.","A very helpful tutorial for research and writing techniques in the history of science","Awesome class. Try to have some idea of what you want to write about before you come in, but it's okay if you don't. It's a lot of work but it's worth it at the end.","Finalize your topic ASAP. The longer it  takes to do this, the longer you'll have to read your sources for and the longer it will take to get a working draft.","This is the class where you decide whether you want to and would enjoy writing a thesis. Not every student would enjoy writing a thesis, and so not every student will enjoy this class. However, HS 98 was a valuable experience.","Start thinking about your topic early on. Do your research early on. Try not to write this paper in the last two weeks, it won't be a fun experience.","Be ready to work hard, and start planning early. The way to not get stressed is to make a plan for yourself and stick to it.","Overall, good tutorial - better than the junior tutorials for many other concentrations from what I've heard from friends. Not as amazing as sophomore tutorial, but overall a solid introduction for how to write a long 20-30 page research paper. Makes me feel more prepared for my thesis."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Get to research a subject of your choice!

It's basically a two\/on and a half semester class in one.","The research process is challenging at first, but if you start with a figure\/event\/object and identify a relevant archive, you will be able to construct a more coherent narrative about your topic of interest.","Start early, seek your TF's and Professor's advice and support, think about a topic over the summer","Junior tutorial has been one of my favorite academic experiences at Harvard! The chance to take an idea you're interested in and run with it has been exciting, empowering, and really really educational. The teaching staff, and in particular, my tf Lisa were endlessly supportive, generating helpful feedback as well as concrete suggestions for areas to improve or expand my paper. It was so exciting to realize an idea, from inception to finished project, and I feel like my understanding of academic papers is much more nuanced and appreciative now! The class really sets you up for success and has gotten me so excited about writing a thesis next year. I also feel like I honed by history of science analytical skills, which is a helpful mark of progress within the concentration.","great if you're thinking about getting into the history of science","If students work hard, they will get a lot out of this class. The more work you put in, the greater the grade, particularly since this assignment is a graded paper.","It's always a challenge to write a good paper, but the support system and structure of this course make it not only bearable but fun. (It's especially nice to have peers who can commiserate\/give you advice.) Archival research is exciting; turning in the final draft has a relieving and satisfying sense of accomplishment. The course teaches fantastic writing and analytical skills, providing you with a solid toolkit to go forth and thesis (if that's your cup of tea) or even just to write better essays in other classes. It may be a required course, but it's one to look forward to.","The class structure and the way it breaks up the paper into a semester long effort is really great! Keep up with the deadlines, reach out to the teaching staff if needed (they are very supportive and willing to help), and enjoy this opportunity to create your own piece of original research!","This course is a lot of work and takes up A LOT of time. Be prepared to work hard. Stay on top of the deadlines and try your hardest not to procrastinate. It is extremely useful and will teach you great skills for inside and outside classroom use. It's pretty awesome because it allows you to explore anything in history of science, technology, and medicine that your interested in. It's super flexible. After this course, you should have a better idea of if you want to thesis or not.","This class gets to be somewhat annoying. You spend every section talking about each person's progress, and it is really redundant (especially when you could be using the time to write the paper). The research kickstarter is really annoying and this class is definitely not graded on whether or not you completed things. They take points off if your feedback isn't good enough, for example. That being said, the TFs and Dr. B. are truly awesome, and they are the reason why this course was a valuable experience. Lisa is amazing and will make you a much better researcher and writer.","This course provides the opportunity to delve into a topic entirely of your own choosing within the history of science. I really enjoyed researching an event that few people had heard of or written about. The teaching team offers excellent support; so even though the research paper can seem daunting at first, they ensure that everyone finishes with something they are proud of.","If you are reading this review, it is likely that you have little choice in whether or not to enroll in this course because it is a concentration requirement. Fortunately, the class is well-structured and has a great deal of support available to guide you through what at times can be a tenuous task.  Be sure to conscientiously complete each step of preparation to make the final writing of your Junior Paper less stressful!","It's a very well-led tutorial. You'll learn a lot!"]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["Take advantage of the resources that are made available to you, especially librarians and tutors.","This class is crucial to learning how to do research within the history of science.

That said, be practical. Using local archival material was particularly useful to me.","Really preps you for the process required for any major independent research project.","This course is challenging, but will become your favorite class if you pick a topic that genuinely interests you. The length of the final paper may seem daunting, but you learn to love the writing process and how it challenges you. Editing the first, full-length draft of your paper is also a great learning experience--it really makes you think critically about your own work and teaches you skills that will come in handy for your other classes.","So you have to take this class because you're a History and Science concentrator. And if you're a concentrator, you'll likely love the experience of delving into a topic that's meaningful to you--this course definitely got me excited about my thesis and was helpful in allowing me to realize how much work will have to go into said thesis. However, your section leader can make or break your experience in this course--don't wait to meet with Professor Baldwin until the end of the paper writing process like I did; if you feel like you're TF isn't quite up to par or guiding you in the process the way other TFs are, let the Professor know and go straight to her for feedback on your drafts.","Sometimes the advising you get within the course is not adequate. I reached out to Professor Harrington (not involved in the course) because she is specializes in my topic. The help I received from her in one meeting was almost equally as helpful as the entirety of the comments and advice I received from my actual TF.","The sophomore tutorial for History of Science is a walk in the park compared to junior tutorial. Be ready to work and be graded more harshly! Make sure to read the grade rubrics to a T.\r\n\r\nIn the month of November you will essentially write your whole 7,000 word essay. It is doable with a heavy-ish  course load but I would strongly recommend that you not take orgo or something of the sort at the same time, if it can be avoided.\r\n\r\nYou'll come away in the end with a piece of original work that you can be proud of and improved research skills. A great intro to what writing a thesis would be like.","This class definitely helps you become a better writer and historian of science.  Completing 30 page paper over the course of the semester takes time so don't overwhelm yourself with harder courses in addition to this class.","1) For future History and Science concentrators, make sure you clear room in your schedule for this class. The things they expect for you to do is only workable with a freer time to go out to do research.","This course takes a LOT of work. Really schedule out your semester before hand to figure out when you will have time to do your research (read secondary sources, go to archives, etc). It is very rewarding, but it is very easy to procrastinate because your work is very unstructured. Deadlines sneak up on you, so watch out!","You have to take this course, so make the most of it. I found a topic that I am now really excited about. Take time to choose your topic; if you do, it will be so much easier to write about it. I realized I love doing research, and that has a lot to do with my topic choice. Don't be afraid to start anew, to go to office hours, and to explore new arguments. And WRITE EARLY AND OFTEN!","This class takes a lot of work but is ultimately pretty rewarding.","stick to deadlines; plan ahead and DO NOT procrastinate","This course is a great opportunity to explore an area of history you are interested in. However, I would caution against picking a topic that is too unconventional or inaccessible through Harvard's archives. I think a great way to start your research would be by identifying specific primary sources you want to look at.","While it is very difficult, this course both prepares you to write a thesis and helps you understand how rewarding a large research project can be.","Junior tutorial is long and tough. Choose a topic that you are really enthusiastic about! Because even so, the course will be tiring. 25-30 pages comes out of the works surprisingly easier than you'd imagine.","Meet early and often with your TF","I wouldn't recommend this class, but everyone has to take it, so it doesn't really matter. I would say get ready for a pretty hard semester. This class took up about 90% of my time, so take other really easy classes with this one.","I absolutely disliked this course. If you're a history and science concentrator, you have to take this course, and I'm so sorry for those of you that have to take it. There is one assignment the entire semester, and you get to choose the topic, but it gets so boring and tiring to work on the same thing the entire semester. For those of you planning to write a thesis, I suppose this would be a good course to prepare you for that, however, I was not and still am not writing a thesis. This class was extremely frustrating because it does imitate the thesis process, but some people already know they don't want to write one, so I felt that this course was a complete waste of time. Also, the structure of this course expects that it's your main priority and basically that it's the only class you're taking the entire semester, which obviously is not true for any students. Also, Professor Baldwin is not a good professor. She literally does not do anything for the course. The only thing I learned from her was where to correctly place periods for a citation in a reference list. Plenaries are so boring and a complete waste of time. Professor Baldwin really should not be teaching this course: she's not approachable and is not helpful and I did not learn anything from her. Sections are also boring, and my TF made the two hour sections extremely painful. You sit for two hours and listen to other people talk about their problems during their writing process, which honestly was such a waste of time and I honestly didn't care what other people were struggling with. Basically, this class is terrible and should not be a mandatory course for history and science concentrators.","There's no way of getting out of this class as it is a requirement, so make it the best it could be! If you go out and search for archives rather than using the convenient ones online or in Widener, Boston is actually a great place to do historical research. I had a lot of fun doing my research and writing the paper, though it was stressful at times.","You have to take this class and it has the potential to be incredible, but for me and most of my peers with whom i spoke, it was a huge disappointment. The course was difficult and required much effort, but there was very little take away. It often seemed like the fact of producing a 30 page paper was enough to make the instructors feel like something substantial was taught in the course, but it was not. Particularly if you've written long papers before and done some research work, there was very little from the instruction to gain from the course.","The class is pretty challenging. It requires that you be incredibly dedicated to researching and eventually writing your paper. Utilize your TF and the professor; they are a great help in providing feedback and helping your solidify your thesis.","I mean, it is one of those course that you kind of have to take, but no one really likes writing a 25 page paper on a time crunch while trying to balance other things."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["This project was challenging but was an invaluable learning experience.","Its a very rigorous course load - don't put off the writing until the last minute."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Do work throughout the semester in terms of writing; don't wait till the last minute to do the paper.","The class is mandatory so if you're reading this, you probably have to take it.  I would probably recommend trying to take it in the fall for the community. It is a hard project to undergo, and I can imagine how much better the experience would be if you have a bunch of friends with you to go through it together, but also a broader base to discuss ideas and troubles with. I also know in the fall they have student groups based around different subject area interests, which seems really helpful. It's hard to have that same experience in a 3 person class; however, if this class is offered again with Lisa, take it. Lisa is the perfect person to teach this class; so intelligent and kind, and she always is able to point out EXACTLY where you are struggling or where your argument is weak or where there is some sort of inconsistency. She is so helpful with every single aspect of writing, from framing questions, expanding your source base, incorporating secondary research, to even nitty gritty details about organization and language. This class is really a solo ride and depends much more on you, your topic and your work ethic than the TF, but having Lisa there every step of the way made it a much better learning experience."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"9.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"2","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HISTSCI 98","course_id":"2637","cat_num":"109660","1s":"2","2s":"1","3s":"11","4s":"13","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HISTSCI 98","course_id":"2637","cat_num":"1120","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HISTSCI 98","course_id":"2637","cat_num":"109660","1s":"0","2s":"17","3s":"9","4s":"1","5s":"3"}},"success":true}
