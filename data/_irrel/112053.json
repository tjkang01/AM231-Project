A huge step up from the 120a and 120b workload with worse teaching.","Only take it if related to concentration or language citation.","It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wonderful! Enjoy! Practice speaking Chinese as much as you can, and NEVER speak English in class. Discipline yourself. Also, make sure and pay attention to the cultural topics we study (Chinese medicine, Beijing opera, idioms, etc.); they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fascinating, and they also play a major role on the exams. Also, I highly recommend you attend the Harvard-Beijing Academy next summer to reinforce what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re learning; it will prove immensely helpful in developing your Chinese fluency and comprehension.","The course is challenging but extremely well-instructed, and is worth every minute","It is a lot of work, but it is as fun as previous Chinese classes.","I would highly recommend that students continue their study of Chinese.  I improved greatly this year, and the course was a lot of fun.","be ready to work hard!  you learn a lot, the teachers are sometimes a little demanding and unforgiving, though, but they are excellent.","It is a lot of work, but can be very fulfilling; by the end of the course, one really feels like they are prepared to begin to converse with native Chinese speakers.","A class with great, passionate teachers that you'll never, ever feel you studied enough for!  Pretty hard to take this class as just another class.  And it's important to be realistic about expectations.  In the end, you have to go to China for an extended period to really learn Chinese.

I know I did.","Go to China if you want to learn Chinese!","You can get by in this class without knowing very much, but if you take advantage of it, you can learn a lot. It depends on how interested you are in actually speaking Chinese.","Study well, do not worry so much about vocabulary as proper grammar usage. Ensure that you have a way to practice speaking on a regular basis.

If you want to put in the work, it is so worth it!","Overall it was a good course! But I feel that my Chinese has not improved that much... it might also be because I took second year Chinese over the summer at HBA and improved my Chinese by a lot. So now that I am no longer immersed in the language... I feel that my learning speed has slowed down. Which it has. But it is still a good course.","As every Chinese course, 130 is well taught and very fun. If you are hesitating between staying at the 120 level or moving on, I definitely encourage you to take it because it will really help you develop your formal Chinese and teach you how to adapt your vocabulary to a situation. You also get to learn a lot more than in previous courses about Chinese culture and society.","The class is a lot of fun.","Chinese 130a is interesting and really delves deeper into the Chinese language than you may have been used to in high school, but be ready to devote a lot of study time to memorizing the characters and sentence patterns, as class meets every day.","I mean, if you like Chinese it's your only option. Possibly don't expect to enjoy it as much as first or second year...","the teachers are great, you learn a lot, the workload isn't too bad.","Be prepared to work very hard, but the gains you make in your language skills will be concrete and rapid.","I'd \"recommend this course with enthusiasm\" if you have a really good reason for learning advanced Chinese. Otherwise, it takes up a lot of time and energy.","Third year is definitely more work than second year, but the movies and clips we watch or more fun.","hard but you get out what you put in. worth it.","Harvard is a great place to learn foreign languages!","it's much easier than the heritage track","The class is useful, but you have to make it so. And hour each day isn't enough for conversant Chinese - go to office hours, talk to the teachers, do the readings, put effort into the essays, and you'll come away with a lot.","The many assignments can seem tedious, but it helps learn the language and makes you practice every day.","This course is great!  It has been my favorite semester of Chinese so far and you will really start to feel like you can express your thoughts in Chinese.  Yan laoshi is very kind and patient and does an excellent job of making the course relevant.  Li laoshi is a badass.  She is the coolest.  Pray that you will have her.","If you are interested at all in furthering your Chinese skills, this is an excellent course to take. It makes the transition from colloquial to formal Chinese very smooth, and in addition, you get to learn about many interesting facets of Chinese culture, such as Beijing Opera. All the teachers are extremely nice, patient, and qualified, so definitely take it!","Chinese 130a is a great course. It is more challenging than 120b. If you have been to China before and learned Chinese through being in China, it is a bit of a disappointment because the pedagogy is just different in comparison to learning in the natural environment. This was a tougher part to get used to. Be prepared to learn more characters than in years past but you will really see your Chinese improve if you put in the extra work.","It is a lot of work, but worth it.  Your language abilities will progress tremendously.  Try to keep your tones!","This class meets every day, so be prepared to work on Chinese every day of the week.  There is no down time, but that is the best way to actually improve in a language.","If you take 123xb before this, this will be easier and nicer than last year. But you definitely learn a lot still and have some fun too!","The teachers in this course were particularly helpful and even assisted me with assignments for other courses that required Chinese.","Really make sure to engage in drill section--it makes it so much fun when you have a great class like I had this semester.","Hopefully you know the drill by now. If you can bei shengci every week and get your homework done on a weekly basis, then you'll have no surprises here.

Great, hardworking section leaders and a great course head have me looking forward to 130b.","As all Chinese classes at Harvard, this course requires a lot of time. If you're willing to put in the work, though, it is very rewarding.","Great continuation of learning Chinese. It will be a bit easy after HBA, though, as there will be a lot of stuff you've already learned before.

The subject matter is interesting, and the teachers are some of the best instructors I have ever had. It is really not that much work.","This course in amazing! The formal\/classical Chinese can be difficult (chapter 8!) but the rest is fine. If you have taken HBA, this course shouldn't be too bad in terms of workload and difficulty.","Great way to cement the language proficiency you've developed with past years of Chinese study.","Simply put, if you are interested in learning Chinese, Harvard has an amazing program for it.","Second year Chinese vocabulary at Harvard was pretty hard. The third year's vocabulary is not as hard, so do not give up!","Chinese is a fairly large amount of work, but the course professors are incredibly sweet and helpful. I was not a great fan of language classes in high school, but I am so glad I tried it out for at leas one semester in college - I am now planning to do a citation!","This class is amazing! Chinese 120 does a good job of preparing you for Chinese 130, and I really think you will all actually be able to focus on the content of the class, instead of worrying about memorizing everything.","you will spend HOURS working for this, but you will learn a lot","The Chinese teachers are so enthusiastic, accessible and make learning this daunting language doable and fun. The class is run so well and you get constant feedback. Highly recommend.","Engage in lecture and section and your Chinese is guaranteed to improve!","Do it...it's fun!","A great way to dramatically improve your Chinese with amazing, dedicated and super-friendly teachers.","Yan Laoshi is amazing. Take this.","Section was wonderful, as the teaching staff was clearly very dedicated. However, the reading material for the course was at times uninteresting, and lectures did not necessarily provide new insight into the written materials.","Take this class. It's so worth it to keep developing your language skills, and the teaching staff will literally do everything they can to help you.","The Chinese 130a teachers are amazing and really want to make sure each student learns the material.  If you put in the time and do the weekly tingxies and homework assignments, they recognize that and the grading isn't too difficult.  If you're interested in taking your Chinese learning to the next level (with a particular emphasis on the difference between formal and informal in both speech and writing), then this course is for you.","Lots of work but everyone is super supportive! You'll be able to tell a difference by the time you're done!","Taking Chinese is the best academic experience I've had at Harvard. It's extremely hard but extremely fun.  And you won't find a friendlier, more accessible teaching staff at Harvard.  Keep at it!","Great course, but be prepared to spend a lot of time.","it is fun","I have heard that all of the language departments are strong at Harvard, and I am sure this is true. However, I have never seen students progress at a faster speed than in the Chinese language department. All of the faculty are wonderful, kind, and helpful. Each level of Chinese I have taken at Harvard has been excellent, and 130a was no exception. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wishes to continue their study of Chinese language. It has helped me immensely.","Definitely a step up memorization-wise from Chinese Ba\/b and the 120s, and I think you start learning more and more words that are more situation specific (i.e. you may not necessarily use them in daily conversation...) but as usual, you're surrounded by excellent teachers who'll definitely be there to help.","Such a fun course!

Requires a lot of work on your own, but really saw improvement in my Chinese this semester","I feel like my improvement wasn't nearly as drastic as after 120a, but it's still a great course, and learning chengyu and suyu is difficult and a little weird, but great for tigao-ing your zhongwen shuiping.","Hu laoshi's teaching style is a lot more repetition and rote-memorization based, but the course overall is very engaging and rewarding. The class is a lot tougher than 120 even just in the scope of the assignments, but the passionate teaching staff makes this course truly wonderful.","If you just stay on top of the regular work this course is not that hard and you will learn a lot. :)","This class is similar to all the other Chinese courses, but I actually found it more manageable. We didn't move outrageously fast through the material, and the tests were fair and straightforward. I really feel more confident in my Chinese now! Also Hu Laoshi is really laid back and a great teacher. The section leaders are also great.","Chinese is always really challenging because of the daily workload. But the teaching staff is the best at Harvard and the class is extremely rewarding overall.","The teachers are incredibly understanding and very helpful.","Amazing class to take. As with all Chinese classes, it takes a tremendous amount of work. But the class is extremely fulfilling. Professor Hu and the TFs are all extremely enthusiastic and make it a fun time in Vanserg. Highly recommend taking the course to expand Chinese knowledge and development.","This course is the logical next choice after 120b. It focuses a lot more on formal written Chinese which can become very frustrating at times - especially with all the cheng yu. However, it still has a good balance of spoken language.","Take this class if you're willing to work and it is important to you.","it's a well-administered class with a strong curriculum. do the work, and you'll find it very rewarding.","A solid third-year course in Chinese; there's a fair amount of review, but also a lot of new characters--some days the dictations were overwhelming! On the whole, though, it's very easy to do well in the course if you put in a little time every day.","The staff is really great. They are all very talented, dedicated, and understanding. However, this course is deeply flawed and hard to recommend to anyone. It feels like a total waste of time to be learning such formal language, a lot of which is vocabulary that you will simply never use in conversation. Also, there needs to be more speaking opportunity. The focus is almost entirely on reading and writing, which is just not nearly as important in learning or using a new language - especially in Chinese, where it's unbearably rote. What's more, the actual in-class speaking opportunity is almost nonexistent, so there's pretty much no opportunity to practice the vocab and \"grammar\" being taught (not that you even would use it in conversation, since it's so formal and unnatural). Another fundamental flaw is that the people coming into this class are from all different levels, many of whom can hardly carry a Chinese conversation. If you're coming out of HBA, you'll be seriously frustrated and feel like you're wasting your time with the subject matter and getting nothing done. My Chinese level definitely regressed over the semester. Take 142 Conversational Chinese instead, unless for some reason you're absolutely intent on learning formal Chinese and focusing almost entirely on characters.","The class is a good transition from Chinese 120. I definitely feel more comfortable with speaking and reading Chinese after taking this course, especially formal Chinese.","Hu Laoshi is one of the best teachers you will likely ever have.","This is a great course. The Chinese department is incredibly dedicated and approachable and all of the teachers are wonderful! The course material is relevant and interesting. If you took 120 at HBA, it can be somewhat repetitive and slow-moving which is occasionally frustrating but it is still a good course.","This is a great class; it's a lot of work but it's also very manageable and enjoyable. The teaching staff is amazing and extremely helpful.","If you're an incoming freshman, the beginning may be a little rocky until you fill in the gaps in your knowledge. Early on you'll frequently be pulling up vocab words in your head that aren't matching what many of your classmates have learned in the past two years. That goes away by the first midterm though, so just soldier on and your grade will be surprisingly fine given how quickly your Chinese will have improved.","You've already taken 2 years of Chinese so......take 130a too!! It's an awesome, fun, extremely well organized class during which you will learn a ton of Chinese. Finish up the last year of your citation (if that's what you're going for) and enjoy it while you do!","Fun course with very kind grading from the teachers. Be careful though, even if you've taken Chinese for two years already, this course may require some more preparation.","The text is pretty funny. The teaching fellows and head teacher are hilarious people and overall, I found it very enjoyable. I would say it is not as good as Ba but it is still good.","Pros: The teachers are amazing. Besides being incredibly well organized, they are energetic, enthusiastic, and excited about the course material. They will correct you on tones, which is important. Exams and homework are fair, because the staff really does want everyone to learn Chinese. \r\nCons: Sometimes the class feels like reciting and memorizing grammar structures instead of making your own sentences. Also, you can get away with not saying a lot in section, which only hurts in the long run. There aren't as many opportunities to speak in class than there should be.","It's not too difficult, work is balanced throughout the term - except for reading period - andyou learn useful things very well.","It is a good class and I learned a lot, but it is very time-intensive and the vocabulary lists can be overwhelming."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Lots of work, but well worth it. Keep on top of the work!","It's a class that took a lot of my time but I was always happy to go to class and drill sections, which says a lot compared to most of my other classes.","Be prepared to work hard + learn a lot!","You should be willing to put in consistent amount of work throughout the semester. As long as you stay on top of everything, this course won't be difficult at all.","Language is a skill you won't regret learning, and here you can learn it without it being a pain (you'll enjoy it!).","If you've already done 120, there's no reason not to take this class! The grammar is a bit more complicated and the texts are a bit more in-depth but all-in-all it's a very natural transition from 120. Take it!","This class is great.  Boring but you learn Chinese.","DO IT.","Great course, especially drill section. Similar to the other Chinese courses before it, except Hu Laoshi is the bomb (and he helps you during dictations). It wasn't so hard for me once I got into a good routine, and I felt it was a nice break from doing readings or psets from other classes.","Once again, the Chinese department at Harvard proves it is one of the best departments at the school. If you're taking 130, by now you should know exactly what to expect from Chinese at Harvard: the teachers are excellent, the assignments are difficult and plentiful but never overwhelming, and the tingxies are tingxies.","I love the laoshis! It was always such a lovely way to start the day, even if Vanserg is in the middle of nowhere.","Chinese 130a is a very enjoyable and manageable class. It's not hard but you have to put time into studying for tests and tingxie. The teachers are great!","The vocabulary is pretty hard. But the course and instructors are fantastic. People who came straight to Chinese 130 rather than after Ba Bb 120a 120b seemed to struggle a little in the beginning because the teachers here focused a lot on tones in Ba Bb 120a 120b.","Chinese 130a is absolutely a worthwhile class! More so than ever before, it focuses on topics that are extremely relevant, interesting, timely, and even a little controversial. You'll learn to discuss issues like Chinese economic issues, pollution and ways to reduce it, marriage and dating, food safety, copyright infringement disputes, etc. The grammar points are very well taught and well structured. Of course, most importantly, the teaching staff of this class are all absolutely phenomenal, some of the most friendly, accessible, talented, and helpful teachers you'll find in the Chinese department!","Chinese 130a is an incredible class. We learn so much new vocabulary and grammar in just a semester and develop an enriched understanding of the issues facing contemporary China.","This class is a great continuation of chinese studies","stay on top of your assignments","The class will teach you the Chinese you want to know.  However, be warned: this class takes up an extraordinary amount of time (just like most language classes, but especially with Asian languages).  I took this course (and 120b) with a five class schedule, and it was absolute hell in terms of workload.  But the class is effective, so that made up for the pressure.  If you want to take 130 (or any Chinese class), don't load up on courses.","You need to put in consistent effort to make it worthwhile (which the teachers do a good job of making sure\/encouraging you do)","This is a great course if you're looking to expand upon your Chinese speaking and reading skills. It has a similar format to Chinese 120 and consists of a lot of vocabulary and grammar memorization, but it is helpful if you want to pursue learning Mandarin. It is not an overly rigorous course and not the best if you're looking to only focus on oral skills.","If you've taken Chinese before at Harvard, you know what you're in for - a fantastic class in basically every way. While harder than 120, it's not an unreasonable step-up - if you had a good grasp of the 120 material, the only thing you really have to work hard on and might present a challenge is speaking and listening skills.","There's a fair amount of work to this class, but it is well rewarded: you will come out with a much better grasp of Chinese reading and writing. This course has been another great semester in Harvard's amazing Chinese language program; I have taken a Chinese class every semester I've been here, and it's always been one of my best-taught and favorite courses every semester."]},"Spring '15":{"comments":["This is an excellent class, the Chinese department is incredibly well organized and I always felt supported throughout the semester.","If you are thinking about quitting after second year, please reconsider. I took this course after a year without any practice speaking or writing the language whatsoever, and found it to be not only doable, but also a wonderful experience (not to mention I earned my citation). The third year teaching staff are some of the best I've encountered in the department.","Way too much material is covered, and the teaching staff is enthusiastic but delusional about how much information students can retain when forced to memorize a whole bunch of words on a daily basis. Impossible to balance with other classes, which is a shame because you do learn a lot. I wish the workload was decreased a little so students can get more enjoyment from it.","The course is pretty straightforward and I really liked the teaching staff. What you learn in class is what comes up on tests. I like that they have tests every 2 chapters, because for once it's not a midterm, it's an actual test, people! Even for the final and the midterm, they really take the stress off by telling you in advance that only the material in 4 chapters will be tested. Other than tests, you get a weekly worksheet, dictation every lecture, and several low-key presentations. More than occasionally, the readings include words you have never seen before if you followed Harvard's Chinese track, and while those words don't show up in the vocab, you are still expected to have known them, which is a little annoying.","It is a great class. I particularly enjoyed the course's focus on learning problems faced by China in its time of rapid development. I found that beyond learning Chinese, I really learned a lot about China as a country.","The instructors are amazing. They will make your day.","Like every other Chinese course I've taken at Harvard, 130b is amazing: it's a lot of work but it teaches you so much, and as hard as it is to get up in the morning to make the trek to Vanserg every day, the teaching staff were the highlight of my day. As Ye Laoshi says: Yi bai fen!","You need to allocate enough time to this class to prepare for the dictations, study for the tests,a dn write the essays.","Once again, Harvard's chinese department is incredible, and the Laoshi's make every day enjoyable (though it starts to get tedious by your third year). You know what to expect, and this is more of the same - tingxie's, baogao's, kaoshi's, etc.","Great course. Great professors and drill section leaders. Only positive things to say.","people will think you're a lot more fluent than you actually are if you don't sound like you're struggling to say everything, please practice your pronunciation","YOU LEARN SO MUCH IT'S AWESOME","This is definitely the logical step after Chinese 120, and it is a good follow-up. The difficulty doesn't increase too much, and the teachers are fantastic. If you actually want to pursue Mandarin, you should definitely continue by taking this course.","An absolutely excellent continuation of the absolutely excellent Chinese 130a. Take it.","Taking this class requires a significant commitment of time and effort, but as long as you put the work in it's worth your while. Even though it meets every day, it can be really fun!","Chinese 130b is the perfect continuation of Chinese studies. All three teachers are immensely qualified, helpful, and passionate. The content of the course is relevant and interesting. Absolutely take this class!"]},"Fall '15":{"comments":["High paced, requires dedication and commitment, but very manageable and very beneficial. You will be very well-equipped by the time you finish the semester.","Chinese department is just amazing, and 130a is no different. I started studying Chinese here at Harvard, and the amazing care that the teachers put into the wonderful work they do, the individual attention they put to each students' work is just unmatched. Just outstanding work overall. Shao laoshi who taught lecture classes, and Wang, Jiang and Kou laoshi who taught small sections were phenomenal at their jobs.","This course - just like the rest of Chinese courses at Harvard - is excellent. The teachers are all very friendly and love what they do, making it really enjoyable to go to class. It's quite a bit of work but I do feel like my Chinese has gotten better. I think something else that is cool is that even though this is a language class, it makes you think about different issues related to China and the United States so it is not only a language class but also a class that can provoke quite a bit of thought. Very good class!","The pedagogy of this course is effective. It keeps you engaged and learning. The teaching is experienced, involved, and enthusiastic. Shao Laoshi is clear, patient, and always prepared. Each of the TAs were equally effective as teachers.","130a is even easier than the 120 series. After getting into the hang of things, 130 is much more manageable.","It takes a lot of time and a lot of work, but you will come away from the class with a greater knowledge of Chinese language and, for the first time since I've gotten to Harvard, cultural issues as well.","If you have taken Chinese at Harvard starting from BA and are concerned about whether or not this course will be worth it I can assure you that it is most definitely worth it.  If you are new to Chinese at Harvard, you should definitely shop the course to see if you can keep up in terms of understanding the teachers and other classmates, especially in section.","It's third year chinese. You should know the drill by now!","The Chinese department is amazing. Please take this course. You won't regret it and you'll learn so much, while also having fun and doing relatively painless assignments. Apart from oral presentations, everything in the course is great!","Best place to learn Chinese!","Take this class! The Harvard Chinese department is the best. It's a lot of work, but at the end of the semester you'll look back and be amazed by the visible progress you've made.","It's a ton of nonstop work, like any Chinese class at Harvard, but as long as you put in the time, you'll do well. All the laoshis are fantastic and really kind and helpful, and the material is organized well.","This course requires work most nights of the week, but the gains show through - your Chinese will improve really quickly. The textbook is really interesting, and the teachers are all amazing, very enthusiastic, great at explaining grammar and new concepts, etc. Definitely a worthwhile class if you're interested in an intensive Chinese experience!","Very straightforward and easy to learn although it is not as fun as 120. A lot more formal, both in how you speak and how you write. The teachers are very helpful though- love the exam preparation sheets that Shao laoshi puts up.","All the teachers are so amazing. That is probably the best part about the class. It is a pretty laid back course. They make the class very engaging so you get to practice Chinese. They really care about every student and always have a smile on their faces. I do think that they don't pay a lot of attention to tones though so that's something I would think about.","If you've taken any Chinese at Harvard before 130, you know the drill. It's pretty much the same except with more grammar\/more vocab. Grading is pretty lenient, and teachers are enthusiastic as usual.","Chinese 130a follows the exact same format as Chinese 120b, but the coarse load is actually slightly easier. The weekly HW assignments are only one page long, and the dictation quizzes have true false instead of short answer questions. The lesson topics, which concern domestic challenges in modern China, are actually very interesting, and they keep you motivated to study harder. Be aware that the course emphasizes listening and reading skills more than speaking and writing, so at times you might get frustrated about how you understand the material well when it's taught and presented to you, but you may stumble a bit when you have to use it on your own. The course needs to do more to improve the writing and speaking proficiency of its students.","Very good for maintaining and improving Chinese, but may not fit into a busy graduate student's schedule","You will definitely learn a lot from this class. The instructors are great, so are the teaching materials and the assignments."]},"Spring '16":{"comments":["Chinese is never the most painless experience, but this course was a great way for me to improve my Chinese. The teaching staff are, as always, absolutely fantastic.","Chinese 130b is like the rest of the Chinese series - very well taught and a lot of work! The teachers are great - they really enjoy the process of teaching. I liked the course, not only because it taught me a lot of Chinese, but also because it forced me to think about a diversity of topics, learning to put together a strong logical argument in Chinese.","A supportive and productive environment to learn Chinese!","Another amazing Chinese class to continue with. Wonderful instructors, great content, and cool essay assignments. You will really feel your Chinese improve to be able to discuss matters like corruption, packaging, soft power etc.","Chinese 130b is exactly what you'd expect: A solid extension of 130a with the same committed, enthusiastic teaching staff, test, essay, and presentation format. It's hard to go wrong here - the staff understand how difficult the language is and are very flexible and forgiving; they want you to love learning the language, and prioritize that as much as grammar or vocab.","I love taking the language, I love the 130b teachers, and it's a small class with people who all want to learn Chinese. It's a fun time and if you do the work, it is not a difficult class. However, I wish that we spoke more in class and were corrected more on our tones because I don't feel lat the level of native speakers yet (we should feel that way if we are to continue on to 140). However, if you are trying to learn the language, that doesn't really matter because you have to take this class. It's great though so I recommend it!","Chinese 130b is an amazing class. I've learnt more Chinese than I did before within the span of a semester. While you learn more grammatical structures to compose more advanced essays, you also get to learn more about global issues through reading the texts. The workload is very manageable too.","This semester is a little more laid back than chinese 130b. Still similar material and very well-taught, as always","Not much different from 130a, topics are pretty interesting. Biweekly dictations, weekly homeworks, etc. same as always. That said, teachers are amazing and you'll be hard-pressed to find teachers as caring and cool as the teachers in the Chinese program. JUST DO IT","The Chinese courses and Harvard are very well structured, and the teachers are very friendly, motivated, and giving. This course exemplified all of that! This semester's topics were also very interesting.","fantastic, as per usual with the Chinese department. addressed lots of global\/chinese issues","Even though you learn a lot of vocabulary words every week, the grammar is not that difficult. It's basically like 130a or even 120 in structure and difficulty.","You will learn an impressive amount of Chinese in this course. I had taken a lot of Chinese before, but learned more quickly in this class than I had before. The teachers do a great job, are all flexible and very kind. Take this class.","Best Chinese department around!","Chinese is great again! Highly recommend!","Chinese 130 was a great experience - the teachers are amazing and really care about our improvement and enjoyment in learning Chinese. It definitely requires work to prepare for quizzes and remember grammar patters, but the course is very worthwhile in terms of seeing improvement and learning a lot of material each week, including pretty interesting topics. If you enjoy learning Chinese and want to improve, this class is a great experience.","This is a great class! It is definitely a good amount of work, but well worth it and very fun.","The Harvard Chinese department rocks! When I think back to when I started with Ba and then look at where I am now, I'm amazed that I've gotten this far, and I'm still excited to take Chinese again next year!","Definitely take it. Always worth it.","If you want to continue improving your Chinese take this course! The teaching staff is great as always."]},"Spring '17":{"comments":["Great class, but very tough. Stay on top of your work","Not that much of a increase in terms of workload from 130a, but you definitely will need to care about Chinese to do well because you constantly have work for this class.","This course, like the Chinese courses before it, is extremely well organized. It follows a very predictable schedule so you are never caught off guard by surprise assignments or tests. The section teachers are excellent. The fact that the course meets everyday for an hour is definitely overkill. It would be much better if the class met 2 or 3 times a week--lessons would be much more productive.","harder and more work than previous chinese classes but still fun and worth it!","The teachers are great. The material and workload ontop of meeting five times a week needs to be heavily considered.","Take this class if you're willing to put in at least 2 hours preparing for quizzes twice a week and then random weekends of a lot of homework.","This course focused a lot on political and social issues that I wasn't very familiar with, but the issues are all across the board so there's bound to be a few lessons that you find really interesting.","If you've taken a Chinese course and liked it here, you'll like this too!","Be prepared to pushed out of comfort zone a bit and talk a lot in class.","High learning to workload ratio, teachers are really chill"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"6.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"30","response rate":"93.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHNSE 130A","course_id":"765","cat_num":"112053","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"30"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHNSE 130a","course_id":"765","cat_num":"6724","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"26","4s":"15","5s":"4"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHNSE 130A","course_id":"765","cat_num":"112053","1s":"2","2s":"13","3s":"14","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
