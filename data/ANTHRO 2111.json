This setting provided an ideal medium to bounce ideas off other students and faculty; multiple opinions really help keep you grounded in terms of what is realistic and what isn't.","This class is a great way to experiment with course design while learning a lot about the complex relationships between humans and the environment. The small class size was a great way to be involved in the course design and engage in a roundtable-type environment. Undergraduates should not shy away from the course, it is very doable and a good opportunity to learn from - and with - graduate students. Take it to enjoy the professors' sense of humor and wit - and knowledge of the subject. The seeming lack of structure may be frustrating at times, but the end product of designing a course makes it worth it.","If you want to have an opportunity to actually learn about how courses are created and are interested in exploring environmental issues from a completely different perspective, this would be a great course for you. It takes up quite a bit of time, but changed the way that I look at the gen ed curriculum immensely. Students have a tendency to complain about classes but not to think about how much work is put into creating them or what it would actually take to change what they don't like."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"4.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"5","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 2111","course_id":"12817","cat_num":"156674","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"7","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 2111","course_id":"12817","cat_num":"156674","1s":"0","2s":"10","3s":"5","4s":"2","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
